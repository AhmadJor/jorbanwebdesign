<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-choose-the-best-web-design-agency-for-your-business"><strong>How to Choose the Best Web Design Agency for Your Business</strong></h2>



<p>When choosing the best web design agency for your business, you must set the proper budget, perform a thorough agency search, contact them, and ask the right questions to ensure they can meet your specific needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-set-the-proper-budget"><strong>How to set the proper budget</strong></h3>



<p>Setting the proper budget for your web design project is crucial to ensure that you get high-quality results without overspending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some critical steps to help you set the proper budget:</p>



<ol>
<li>Assess Your Business Needs: Take the time to evaluate your business needs and goals. Determine what features and functionalities you require for your website, such as e-commerce capabilities or a content management system (CMS).</li>



<li>Consider Project Complexity: Consider the complexity of your web design project. Complex projects may require more resources and time, impacting the overall cost.</li>



<li>Research Market Rates: Research the market rates for web design services in your area or industry. This will give you a general idea of how much you should expect to pay for different websites or specific functionalities.</li>



<li>Define Your Scope of Work: Clearly define the scope of work for your project. List all deliverables, such as page designs, responsive layouts, and integration with third-party tools or platforms.</li>



<li>Request Multiple Quotes: Reach out to several web design agencies and request quotes based on your defined scope of work. This will allow you to compare prices and services offered by different agencies.</li>



<li>Look Beyond Cost: While cost is essential, it shouldn&#8217;t be the determining factor when choosing a web design agency. Consider factors like their portfolio, reputation, expertise, and ability to deliver on time.</li>



<li>Plan for Ongoing Maintenance: When setting your budget, factor in ongoing maintenance costs. Regular updates, bug fixes, security patches, and hosting fees are essential for running your website smoothly.</li>



<li>Be Realistic: Be realistic about what you can afford while still meeting your business objectives. Set a budget allowing room for unexpected expenses or additional features that may arise during development.</li>



<li>Communicate Openly: Communicate openly with the web design agency about your budget constraints from the start. A good agency will work with you to find creative solutions within your budget.</li>



<li>Consider Long-Term ROI: While setting a reasonable budget is essential, consider your website&#8217;s long-term return on investment (ROI). A well-designed and functional website can drive traffic, conversions, and revenue for your business.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-perform-an-agency-search"><strong>How to perform an agency search</strong></h3>



<p>Performing an agency search is a crucial step in finding the best web design agency for your business. Here are some essential tips to help you navigate the whole design process:</p>



<ol>
<li>Start with a clear understanding of your business needs: Before beginning your agency search, identify your specific goals and requirements. Determine what you want to achieve with your website and what features or functionality you need.</li>



<li>Conduct thorough research: Use online resources, industry directories, and recommendations from colleagues to compile a list of potential web design agencies. Consider their specialties, experience, and client reviews.</li>



<li>Review their website and portfolio: Visit each agency&#8217;s website to understand their design style, user experience, and overall professionalism. Look at their portfolio to see examples of their previous work, paying attention to projects similar to yours.</li>



<li>Assess their success record: Look for evidence of the agency&#8217;s track record in delivering successful projects. Check if they have case studies or testimonials demonstrating their ability to meet client expectations and deliver results.</li>



<li>Inquire about innovative design and approach: Ask the agencies about their web design and development approach. Find out if they stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends and have a history of implementing innovative solutions for clients.</li>



<li>Request client testimonials: Reach out to current or past clients of the agencies on your list. Ask about their experience working with the agency, the quality of the delivered work, and whether they achieved their anticipated results.</li>



<li>Ask relevant questions: Prepare a list addressing your concerns or requirements. Inquire about project timelines, pricing structures, communication processes, post-launch support options, and other relevant details.</li>



<li>Consider budget limitations: While it&#8217;s important not to compromise on quality when selecting a web design agency, it&#8217;s also crucial to consider your budget limitations from the outset. Be clear about your budget expectations early on in discussions with potential agencies.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-questions-to-ask-the-agency"><strong>What questions to ask the agency</strong></h3>

<p>Are you starting to see your ecommerce revenue plateau? The fix could be upselling and cross selling! These strategies are proven to boost sales, enhance customer experience, and improve retention. And with the help of some Shopify apps, implementing these tactics has never been easier. We’ve compiled this list of the best Shopify apps for upselling and cross selling. So dig in to see which ones you can implement ASAP!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-upselling-and-cross-selling-in-increasing-ecommerce-revenue">Importance of Upselling and Cross Selling in Increasing Ecommerce Revenue</h2>



<p>Upselling and cross-selling are essential strategies for boosting eCommerce revenue. Upselling entails persuading customers to purchase upgraded versions of their selection, while cross-selling means presenting complementary items that pair well with the item they’re considering. By utilizing these techniques, Shopify stores have been able to increase their average order value (AOV) significantly. These practices can also help companies build a more loyal customer base, which leads to repeat purchases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-increased-average-order-value">Increased Average Order Value</h3>



<p>If you’re looking for ways to increase your revenue on Shopify, one effective strategy is to focus on increasing your AOV. By encouraging customers to spend more per order,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Higher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/average-order-value#:~:text=Average%20order%20value%20(AOV)%20is%20an%20important%20metric%20for%20any,expensive%20products%20or%20cross%2Dselling." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average order values</a>&nbsp;mean you’re able to achieve the same amount of revenue while serving less customers, which makes it slightly easier to reach those sales goals. Or, imagine if you increased your AOV AND the number of customers served? How would that improve your bottom line? Not to mention, you’re shipping more items at a time, leading to better margins.</p>



<p>So how can you achieve higher AOV? One simple way is to use upselling and cross-selling tactics, which can be easily implemented through top-rated Shopify apps. These apps provide targeted product recommendations based on customer behavior, making it easy to suggest related items or upgrades that complement their current purchase.</p>



<p>By focusing on increasing your AOV through upselling and cross-selling techniques, you’ll see a significant impact on your bottom line while also improving customer loyalty.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhanced-customer-experience-increased-retention">Enhanced Customer Experience &amp; Increased Retention</h3>



<p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “it costs more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.”</p>



<p>There’s nothing more important than providing your customers with a great shopping experience. Not only does this help&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/strategies-to-boost-ecommerce-sales-and-customer-loyalty/">build loyalty</a>&nbsp;and trust, but it also encourages repeat business and referrals.</p>



<p>By suggesting complementary products or upgrades based on their purchase history, you’re showing your customers that you understand their needs and are committed to providing them with personalized recommendations.</p>



<p>Not only does this improve the overall shopping experience, but it can also lead to increased sales and, you guessed it, higher average order values. Customers will appreciate the convenience of having related items suggested to them without having to search for them on their own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boosted-sales-and-revenue">Boosted sales and revenue</h3>



<p>Don’t miss out on the opportunity to grow your business – start implementing upselling and cross-selling techniques through Shopify apps today. With increased sales and revenue, you’ll have more resources to invest in improving your store’s offerings and expanding your customer base.</p>

<p>These days, it takes more than just having a website to make the most of your online presence. Consumers are looking for the ultimate user experience, and if your website doesn’t provide it, they’ll take their business elsewhere. This can do irreparable damage to your site’s performance and, ultimately, your brand’s reputation.</p>



<p>You’re not alone, though. The average landing page conversion rate is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only around 2.35%</a>. However, the top 25% of websites have conversion rates that are more than double this number.</p>



<p>To get the most out of every website visit, you need to pay careful attention to website conversion rate optimization. Understanding the principles of CRO helps you optimize your site to draw in more visitors and convert them into paying customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-conversion-rate-optimization">Understanding Conversion Rate Optimization</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/conversion-rate-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conversion rate optimization</a> (CRO) refers to the process of improving your website’s ability to convert visitors into paying customers. It entails processes like analyzing visitor behavior, testing different design elements, and tweaking content for maximum impact.</p>



<p>Optimization is crucial if you want to make the most of your website redesign. A good CRO strategy will ensure that visitors are more likely to take the desired action (e.g., buying a product, signing up for a newsletter) when they land on your page.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-metrics-and-goals-of-cro">Key Metrics and Goals of CRO</h3>



<p>These are the overarching metrics and goals of CRO:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-increase-conversion-rates">Increase Conversion Rates</h4>



<p>CRO helps identify areas of improvement in order to maximize conversions from visitors. Conversions don’t just mean getting a visitor to purchase something, it can also mean getting them to download a free tool or sign up for your newsletter.</p>



<p>The main point is to get them to give their information, which you can use to nurture them into becoming loyal customers or followers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improve-user-experience">Improve User Experience</h4>



<p>User experience (UX) plays a key role in CRO. UX is how visitors interact with your site. Making sure your site is user-friendly and easy to navigate ensures visitors can find what they need quickly and easily, helping to increase the chances of conversion.</p>



<p>Elements like page layout, color scheme, font choices, navigation menus, and page load times can all contribute to a great <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/user-experience-conversions/">user experience that converts</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boost-cta-effectiveness">Boost CTA Effectiveness</h4>



<p>Your calls-to-action (CTAs) also affect the success of your redesign efforts. CTAs should be simple, yet powerful. They must stand out from the rest of your website and be easily located. Furthermore, they should make use of persuasive language to encourage the user to take action.</p>



<p>Creating effective, eye-catching CTAs that are easy for users to find and click on can improve your conversion rate optimization significantly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evaluating-your-current-website">Evaluating Your Current Website</h2>



<p>Before launching into a website redesign, it’s important to evaluate your current website and its performance. Start off by looking at the conversion rate of each page on your site. This will help you determine which pages are converting visitors into leads or customers and which areas need improvement.</p>



<p>Additionally, look at what types of content are attracting more attention from viewers. This can also provide insight as to what is working well and what could be adjusted with the upcoming redesign.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defining-website-redesign-goals">Defining Website Redesign Goals</h2>



<p>After getting an idea of what’s working and what’s not working on your current site, it’s time to dig deep and understand what you want your <a href="https://www.growthdrivendesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth-driven design</a> to achieve. Do you want your site to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Generate more sales and leads?</li>



<li>Boost traffic and engagement?</li>



<li>Enhance user experience and improve usability?</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these objectives are important, but you must also consider how they work together.</p>



<p>For example, increasing website traffic is only helpful if it helps generate more conversions. Similarly, improving the user experience can help increase conversions but won’t matter much if visitors don’t stay on your site long enough to purchase anything.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crafting-a-conversion-focused-design">Crafting a Conversion-Focused Design</h2>



<p>One of the <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/what-are-the-steps-of-conversion-optimization/">quick-win steps of CRO</a> is to focus on whitespace and design. The goal is to make sure the website focuses on the primary message or call-to-action (CTA).</p>



<p>This means having clear navigation, a well-organized layout, and plenty of whitespace. Whitespace helps to draw attention to key elements and creates an overall sense of clarity for visitors, which in turn can help increase conversion rates.</p>



<p>When designing your website be sure that you are taking into account how users interact with it. This includes understanding their expectations and how they progress through the website. For example, with <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/contact-forms-that-convert/">contact forms</a>, make sure that you keep them short and have enough whitespace so that users don’t feel overwhelmed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-optimizing-landing-pages-and-calls-to-action">Optimizing Landing Pages and Calls to Action</h2>



<p>Landing pages are the entry point for visitors to your website, so it’s important that they be designed with optimization in mind. Personalized landing pages are a great way to <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-conversion-rate-optimization/">increase conversions</a> as they give visitors a more tailored experience.</p>



<p>Additionally, calls to action should be clear and concise, as too many options can confuse visitors and actually cause them to leave the page without taking any action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-catering-to-the-mobile-audience">Catering to the Mobile Audience</h2>



<p>With <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/how-many-people-have-smartphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6.8 billion smartphone users</a>, this consumer segment should be at the heart of your website redesign. Also, with Google’s new mobile-first indexing policy, it is more important than ever to ensure that your website functions and looks great across all devices.</p>



<p>To make the most of this wave of mobile users, ensure that you are catering to their needs by incorporating mobile-friendly design features such as responsive web design, accelerators, and larger clickable areas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-and-analyzing-results">Measuring and Analyzing Results</h2>



<p>Analyzing data from Google Analytics can tell you a lot about user behavior on your site. Look at which pages generate the most traffic, what content users browse, and the paths they take to get there. You can also use this information to identify any areas of your site that could be improved, such as pages with high bounce rates or low conversion rates.</p>



<p>The most important data you need to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calculate for website optimization</a> is your overall conversion rate. This is the percentage of visitors who complete a desired action (such as making a purchase) out of all those who visit your site. Knowing this number allows you to measure the effectiveness of your website and track changes as you make improvements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-transform-your-website-for-cro-take-action-for-success">Transform Your Website for CRO: Take Action for Success</h2>



<p>When it comes to website conversion rate optimization, having the right knowledge and taking action is essential. Knowing what factors affect conversion rates, conducting A/B tests, and analyzing user behavior all serve to help you understand where improvements can be made. With a thoughtful redesign that takes into account the needs of users, your website will become an effective tool for turning visitors into customers.</p>

<p>Whether you’re undergoing a website redesign for your business or launching a new product, the timeline to bring the idea to fruition can be daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just ask the Wright Brothers, who spent four years designing and building their first airplane. They had plenty of highs and lows throughout their journey, but in 1903 they made history when they flew at Kitty Hawk.</p>



<p>Today, businesses have access to technology, making creating products and launching websites much more accessible than ever. But while timelines may be shorter than ever, many steps are still involved in bringing an idea to life online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s discuss what you should expect and how working with a web designer helps you through the inevitable bumps in the road.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-website-redesign-goals-and-benefits">Website Redesign Goals and Benefits</h2>



<p>Aside from asking&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-cost-guide/">how much a redesign costs</a>, we often receive this other question a lot: how long does a website redesign project take? The short answer is that the timeline depends on your project goals. A complete overhaul of an existing website with many custom features, integrations, and content will take more time than simply creating new visuals for a landing page.</p>



<p>Most companies&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-fix-bad-website-designs/">redesign their website</a>&nbsp;as part of a larger business strategy. Their goals might be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create a better user experience</li>



<li>Generate more leads and sales</li>



<li>Improve SEO rankings</li>



<li>Enhance content marketing efforts</li>



<li>Refresh the website’s look and feel</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever the goal is, it’s essential to have clear objectives that are achievable within your timeline. Some of these goals take a long time to achieve on their own, so be realistic about your expectations based on the goals you have in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-growth-driven-design-process">Growth-driven Design Process</h2>



<p>While some websites can be designed, developed, and launched in weeks, most projects require more careful planning. That’s why many companies turn to <a href="https://www.growthdrivendesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth-driven design</a> (GDD) as an effective solution for website redesign.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/whats-growth-driven-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth-driven design</a> is a process that starts with creating a minimum viable product (MVP), or the basic functionality and design of the website. From there, the design is constantly iterated based on real-time data, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>User Feedback</li>



<li>Analytics</li>



<li>A/B Testing</li>
</ul>



<p>This process allows for continuous improvements over time that help achieve the desired goals quicker than with a traditional redesign. Further, since the website is being improved gradually, companies can also cut down on their costs as it eliminates the need for a massive overhaul at one time.</p>



<p>Here at Jorban, we employ a GDD strategy for every website redesign project. In a nutshell, we go through extensive onboarding, gathering as much information as possible, designing your website, and implementing real-time improvement strategies throughout the project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-website-redesign-timeline">Website Redesign Timeline</h2>



<p>A typical website redesign timeline with Jorbantakes around four to six months, although it can vary based on the complexity of your project. The timeline usually looks something like this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategy-session">Strategy Session</h3>



<p>The first thing you’ll do with our web design agency is figure out your strategy and goals. This includes researching competitors, analyzing customer feedback, and ensuring the website aligns with your brand identity.</p>



<p>Your&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/">web design team</a>&nbsp;submits a proposal outlining your project’s timeline, deliverables, and cost. Sometimes, this also includes a wireframe or creative brief. After both sides agree on the details, you’ll sign a contract with your web design team. Your contract should include the following elements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scope of Work:</strong>&nbsp;Definition of the project goals and objectives and what elements will be included in the website design process.</li>



<li><strong>Timeline:</strong>&nbsp;The timeline for completing the web design project, including significant milestones and any dependencies between tasks and their estimated duration.</li>



<li><strong>Cost Breakdown:</strong>&nbsp;A breakdown of costs associated with each stage of the web design project, such as hosting or graphic designing services.</li>



<li><strong>Rights and Ownership:</strong>&nbsp;Details on who owns which rights over creative materials produced during the process (graphics, videos, etc.).</li>



<li><strong>Payment Terms and Conditions:</strong>&nbsp;Agreement on payment terms, including payment schedule and method(s) accepted by both parties (e-check/credit card/cash).</li>



<li><strong>Termination Clause:</strong>&nbsp;If either party would like to terminate early from a contract, they should clarify this ahead of time so there are no misunderstandings when it comes time to end things officially down the line if needed.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-project-kickoff">Project Kickoff</h3>



<p>Once you get your contract signed, you’ll attend a series of meetings with your web design team to get to the nitty-gritty details of your website redesign. This is the time to get really clear on what you want from your website and&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-redesign-project-plan/">devise a plan</a>&nbsp;for how to make it happen.</p>



<p>Your project kickoff should be extensive since you’ll be mapping out the entire website redesign process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-1-meet-the-team-project-alignment">Meeting 1: Meet the Team + Project Alignment</h4>



<p>Ideally, your first meeting should be a meet-and-greet with the team working on your website. You should also discuss your expectations, goals, and possible risks associated with your web design project so you and your team are on the same page.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-2-brand-discovery">Meeting 2: Brand Discovery</h4>



<p>Your next meeting’s discussion primarily focuses on exploring your brand and developing a plan for how to incorporate it into the web design. This meeting involves researching your market and target audience, so you can decide on a tone and style that will best appeal to them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-3-site-architecture">Meeting 3: Site Architecture</h4>



<p>Now that you have a good idea of what your website should look like, it’s time to start thinking about its structure. This meeting involves sketching out the layout and flow of your website so that it’s easy to access different pages and sections. You’ll also develop your site’s revamped navigation system and how you want to organize the content.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-4-page-intentions">Meeting 4: Page Intentions</h4>



<p>Your website isn’t just your homepage. You’ll also need to figure out what content and features you want each page to have. This involves deciding on the types of calls-to-action, forms, images, and other interactive elements that will make your website more engaging.</p>



<p>Other pages of your website typically include:</p>



<ul>
<li>About page</li>



<li>Contact page</li>



<li>Blog page</li>



<li>Other pages depending on how you decide to structure your site</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-5-brandscript-voice">Meeting 5: Brandscript + Voice</h4>



<p>Another critical thing to consider when starting your project would be your brandscript. Your brandscript is a document that outlines the overall feel of your website, from its visual language to how you want it to sound when users visit.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meeting-6-website-inspiration">Meeting 6: Website Inspiration</h4>



<p>Reinventing the wheel isn’t always necessary. You can look for existing websites with features you like and incorporate them into your design as long as they fit with the overall vision for your project. This meeting involves researching similar website designs to get inspired and develop a unique web design plan that stands out from the competition.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stakeholder-interviews">Stakeholder Interviews</h4>



<p>Your project&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-convince-leadership-to-redesign-the-website/">involves more stakeholders</a>&nbsp;than you may realize. It’s essential to involve everyone that the website redesign affects, such as marketing managers and content writers. Interviewing stakeholders helps you better understand what they need from your website design so that you can incorporate their suggestions into your project plan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discovery">Discovery</h3>



<p>This stage of the website redesign timeline synthesizes everything you’ve done from previous meetings, stakeholder interviews, and research. This is the time to sort through all of your information, iron out any possible kinks in your plan, and determine what will be included in the website’s design.</p>



<p>Here, you’ll discuss project takeaways and create a sitemap to figure out the structure of your website. You’ll also plan user flows and journeys throughout your website and identify any potential areas that might need extra attention.</p>



<p>Analyzing how your competition does these three things also helps with the discovery process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creative">Creative</h3>



<p>Here’s the fun part! Now that you have a well-researched plan for your website design, it’s time to bring it to life. This phase is divided into four smaller steps.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wireframes">Wireframes</h4>



<p>Wireframes are your blueprints for your website’s design. They help you map out the structure and layout of your web pages and how a user can interact with them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moodboards">Moodboards</h4>



<p>Another crucial step in the creative process of website design is creating moodboards. Think of your moodboard as a visual representation of your project’s spirit and personality. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Images</li>



<li>Colors</li>



<li>Fonts</li>



<li>Graphics</li>



<li>Other elements that could be incorporated into your website design</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-transition-from-wireframes-into-hi-fi">Transition From Wireframes Into Hi-Fi</h4>



<p>Before we go any further, we need to decide on a design direction. This is where the transition from wireframes into high-fidelity mockups comes in. Hi-fi mocks are a visual representation of what your website will look like after it’s fully developed and ready for launch.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-fidelity-hi-fi-designs">High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Designs</h4>



<p>After you create hi-fi mockups, it’s time to design the actual look of your website. In this phase, we’ll start building our web pages and applying all of the elements from our moodboard to the pages.</p>



<p>This includes selecting colors for backgrounds or buttons, creating animations for interactive objects, and selecting fonts for headings and body copy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seo">SEO</h3>



<p>Website redesigns should also include a review of your SEO strategy. The goal is to ensure that the website follows all of the best practices for SEO and has been optimized for search engine crawlers.</p>



<p>In this stage, you’ll conduct keyword discovery when you determine which keywords to target for SEO optimization. You’ll also analyze your URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions to ensure they meet SEO standards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-copywriting">Copywriting</h3>



<p>Put your keywords to work with copywriting. This is the process of crafting persuasive and educational content for your website. Copywriters must focus on finding a balance between appealing to users, optimizing for search engines, and providing value.</p>



<p>Conducting a copywriting exercise means you have to review the existing copy on your website and create new content where necessary.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-copywriting-direction-document">Copywriting Direction Document</h4>



<p>When redesigning your website, you’ll probably work with a team of writers. That’s why it’s crucial to create a document that everyone can use when writing your website copy.</p>



<p>This copywriting direction document identifies pages that need new copy, outlines the required content type (e.g., FAQs or product descriptions), and explains the writing style to use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asset-sourcing">Asset Sourcing</h3>



<p>The next stage in the website redesign timeline is finding or creating your website assets, such as illustrations, images, and videos. You can ask your web design team if they’re developing assets in-house or sourcing these assets for you. Of course, your creative input is also welcomed at this stage. You can suggest inspirations for the assets you have in mind and let your team work their magic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-development">Development</h3>



<p>Now that everything’s collected, designed, and ready to go, it’s time for the development process. This is where all of your website design elements come together.</p>



<p>Your web design team builds the site structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’ll take care of integrating plugins, creating custom animations, and optimizing content for search engine crawlers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quality-assurance">Quality Assurance</h3>



<p>Before you can even think about launching, you have to test your website. This is the quality assurance phase, and it’s vital for website redesigns since there are so many moving parts that need to be tested.</p>



<p>Your web design team tests all links, animations, and features to ensure they work correctly before launch. They’ll fix all the quirks and bugs that might pop up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-launch">Launch</h3>



<p>After months of hard work, the development team has created a website that your business is proud of. It’s time to launch!</p>



<p>Your web design team conducts one last review to ensure everything is perfect, and then they’ll push the website live. You can now show off your brand-new look online and enjoy all its benefits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-post-launch-and-website-maintenance">Post Launch and Website Maintenance</h2>



<p>Even after the launch, your website is a constantly evolving asset that needs regular maintenance to keep running smoothly.</p>



<p>The best web design agencies include ongoing maintenance and support just in case anything goes wrong with your website after launch. This means they’ll continue to monitor your website’s quality in terms of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>SEO</li>



<li>Technical aspects like speed and structure</li>



<li>User experience</li>
</ul>



<p>Ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/website-support/">support and maintenance retainers</a>&nbsp;like Jorbanare essential in keeping your website updated and running efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-build-beautiful-websites-with-huemor">Build Beautiful Websites With Jorban</h2>

<p>It’s hard to imagine a world without Software as a Service (SaaS). It’s become so ubiquitous that it’s easy to forget how far we have come since the days when computers were little more than big, bulky boxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like cars, SaaS is now available in all different shapes and sizes — from sleek and modern designs to classic models. And with the ever growing diversity in offerings, it’s vital for companies who offer SaaS products to create&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-saas-website-examples/">attractive websites and homepages</a>&nbsp;that stand out from the competition.</p>



<p>But what makes a good SaaS homepage design?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it the design? The features? Or is there something else that’s more important? Here is a list of tips to help you create great SaaS homepages and website designs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-value-forward-design">Value-forward Design</h2>



<p>Unlike&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/ecommerce-homepage-design/">e-commerce and retail brands</a>, SaaS companies need to clarify what their product does and why people should use it. This means having a value-forward homepage design that attractively showcases the service’s features. Think about how you can showcase your product’s features on the homepage without overwhelming visitors with too much information.</p>



<p>It’s also essential to clarify any pricing plans or subscription options so visitors know exactly what they are getting for their money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-impressions-matter">First Impressions Matter</h3>



<p>Homepages need to make a good first impression. This means&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/saas-landing-pages-best-practices/">implementing best practices</a>&nbsp;that draw people in and keep them on the page long enough for them to explore your product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A well-designed homepage should feature eye-catching visuals, clear headlines, and concise descriptions that introduce visitors to what the site is all about.</p>



<p>For example, take a look at one of our awesome customers —&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/better-cloud/">BetterCloud</a>. The homepage is sleek, eye-catching, and to the point.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="446" height="279" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bettercloud-announcement-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-40438" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bettercloud-announcement-edited-1.jpg 446w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bettercloud-announcement-edited-1-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-above-and-below-the-fold-design">Above- and Below-the-Fold Design</h3>



<p>One excellent way to keep visitors on your page is to design with both above-the-fold and below-the-fold in mind.</p>



<p>Designs&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/above-the-fold?__hstc=224151812.85e2f9509f4683b63a57189bba8af12d.1685019560483.1685019560483.1685040585030.2&amp;__hssc=224151812.1.1685040585030&amp;__hsfp=1136147948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>above-the-fold</strong></a>, or content immediately visible upon loading your homepage, should focus on highlighting the key features of your product without overwhelming visitors with too much information. Keep it straightforward, with a few visuals and clear headlines that introduce people to what your SaaS company is all about.</p>



<p><strong>Below-the-fold</strong>, where users have to scroll to, your<strong>&nbsp;</strong>designs should be focused more on providing detailed content, such as pricing plans, subscription options, or customer testimonials. This way, you engage visitors and keep them interested in exploring your product further.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-and-concise-descriptions">Simple and Concise Descriptions</h3>



<p>Just because you’re offering a high-tech solution doesn’t mean you should dump paragraphs of&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-homepage-design-examples/">technical jargon onto your homepage</a>. Instead, use simple and concise descriptions to explain what the product does and why people should use it. This helps to create an emotional connection with visitors, which can encourage them to sign up for your service.</p>



<p>Think beyond just your subscription and pricing model. This ties back to adding value, and you can do this through effective branding and the best SaaS website designs. For example, you can share stories about your company’s values, mission, and vision — showcasing the real people behind your product.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-define-value-by-comparing-and-contrasting-saas-providers">Define Value by Comparing and Contrasting SaaS Providers</h2>



<p>You’re just one of many who offer SaaS solutions, which is why defining your value proposition is so important. A great way to do this is by comparing and contrasting your product with other solutions on the market.</p>



<p>You can do this in various ways, from highlighting unique features to showing how much money customers can save using your service. Doing this makes it easier for potential customers to choose your SaaS solution over others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offering-service-tiers">Offering Service Tiers</h3>



<p>When offering multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/03/tips-and-insights-on-building-a-successful-saas-platform/?sh=7a0ebd2deeb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tiers of services or pricing</a>, think about this: can people see themselves in one of these tiers? It’s not just what’s cheaper or more premium. It’s also about what tier best serves their needs. Are they a one-man show, working on a personal project? Or are they part of a larger team with more complex needs?</p>



<p>Thinking about it this way, you can highlight the features that matter most to each user, making it easier for them to choose the tier they need.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emphasize-what-you-can-do-and-what-your-competitors-can-t-do">Emphasize What You Can Do (and What Your Competitors Can’t Do)</h3>



<p>Here’s the thing: your customers are also checking out your competitors’ sites. As a matter of fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/shopping-research-before-purchase-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 53% of them are</a>&nbsp;before making any kind of purchase. To stand out, you need to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/saas?__hstc=224151812.85e2f9509f4683b63a57189bba8af12d.1685019560483.1685019560483.1685040585030.2&amp;__hssc=224151812.1.1685040585030&amp;__hsfp=1136147948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emphasize what sets you apart</a>&nbsp;from the competition. This could be anything, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Special features</li>



<li>Pricing plans</li>



<li>Customer service and support</li>
</ul>



<p>You have to assume that your customers are bombarded with tons of information and that it’s hard to process which SaaS option they should choose. You have to make the process easier for them by highlighting the differences that matter.</p>



<p>If you have testimonials that do the comparing and contrasting, even better! Your potential clients have probably already tried various SaaS solutions in the past before stumbling across yours. They’re looking for reassurance that you are the right choice and not just another one of the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-your-saas-homepage-design-to-show-the-conversations-you-re-having">Use Your SaaS Homepage Design to Show the Conversations You’re Having</h2>



<p>Context is vital when it comes to SaaS marketing. Show visitors your conversations with potential customers, both on and off your website.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotlight-your-satisfied-clients">Spotlight Your Satisfied Clients</h3>



<p>One way to boost customer confidence is by using customer stories&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/best-content-for-a-homepage/">directly from your homepage</a>. What does a successful application of your SaaS look like? Why do your customers continue using your solution instead of alternative providers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting success stories, like we assisted&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/centivo/">Centivo</a>&nbsp;in doing, helps potential customers decide whether your product is right for them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-centivo-home-minb-edited-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-40439" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-centivo-home-minb-edited-1024x576-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-centivo-home-minb-edited-1024x576-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-centivo-home-minb-edited-1024x576-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leverage-your-blogs">Leverage Your Blogs</h3>



<p>Any SaaS website should have a blog section, as this allows you to demonstrate your expertise and showcase what sets your product apart from others on the market. Blogs allow you to explain complex topics in a way that is easy for readers to understand — giving them insight into why they should choose your solution over the competition.</p>



<p>Your customers are experts in their fields, meaning they demand working with someone just as knowledgeable. This is where your blog comes in. By sharing content that addresses their needs, you’ll demonstrate your expertise and build trust with potential customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demonstrate-how-you-solve-industry-specific-challenges">Demonstrate How You Solve Industry-specific Challenges</h3>



<p>Your customers don’t always belong in the same industry, so it’s crucial to demonstrate how your SaaS product helps solve specific challenges within each industry. By showing how your solution addresses these unique needs, you make it easier for potential customers to see the value in what you offer.</p>



<p>For example, if you specialize in accounting software, you could discuss how your product helps small businesses keep track of their income and expenses. This shows you understand their industry-specific challenges and can help them solve them.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you offer a project management solution, discuss how it helps teams streamline their processes and collaborate better to reach their goals.</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/26/2023-predictions-for-saas-solutions-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry challenges</a>&nbsp;are also transferable across industries. For example, security is always a concern for businesses regardless of size or industry. Showing how your product helps customers manage and secure their data would benefit all types of customers.</p>



<p>Demonstrating the value you offer to each industry makes it easier for potential customers to understand why they should choose your SaaS solution over the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for an example, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/tripleseat/">Tripleseat</a>. We helped them create distinct sections on their site so each customer can select which subset of their services they need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ServiceOverview_TripleSeat@2x-edited-2048x1151-1-1024x576-1.jpg?ver" alt="" class="wp-image-40440" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ServiceOverview_TripleSeat@2x-edited-2048x1151-1-1024x576-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ServiceOverview_TripleSeat@2x-edited-2048x1151-1-1024x576-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ServiceOverview_TripleSeat@2x-edited-2048x1151-1-1024x576-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-samples-try-our-saas-yourself">Free Samples: Try Our SaaS Yourself!</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/saas-and-technology-websites/">best SaaS website designs</a>&nbsp;talk about more than just the value they offer. They also let customers try it for themselves.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-q-a-or-real-time-assistance">Q&amp;A or Real-time Assistance</h3>



<p>Customer service plays a huge role in the buying decision. Customers want to know they can get help when needed, so be sure to have a support page on your website. After reading your blog posts and success stories, users should be equipped to progress on their own, but may need help at any point.</p>



<p>You could add a Q&amp;A page that answers common questions and concerns or offer real-time assistance with live chat. This gives customers confidence in knowing that if they run into issues with your product, someone is available to help them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-trials">Free Trials</h3>



<p>Ah, the classic free trial. This is a must-have for any SaaS website as it allows users to test your product before committing to anything. There’s no better way to qualify your lead than to let them try out the product themselves and see if it fits their needs.</p>



<p>You can also bundle these free trials with a problem they can try solving, such as free datasets, pre-defined samples, or anything that shows customers how your product works.</p>



<p>Your free datasets can even function as lead magnets since customers who try them out will likely be curious to learn more about your product. For example, image annotation tool&nbsp;<a href="https://labelbox.com/datasets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Labelbox</a>&nbsp;uses free resources to promote their own blogs and other content.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="806" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-12.23.35-PM-1024x806-1.png?ver" alt="" class="wp-image-40441" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-12.23.35-PM-1024x806-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-12.23.35-PM-1024x806-1-300x236.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-12.23.35-PM-1024x806-1-768x605.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Setting up an eCommerce store can be both exciting and overwhelming. Choosing the right platform is crucial for smooth operations and profitability. WordPress is a popular option for online stores, with many eCommerce plugins to choose from, but deciding on the right plugin can feel like a daunting task.</p>



<p>This list compares five popular WordPress eCommerce plugins of 2023, including their features, advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we assess other factors such as customization options and customer support to aid in your decision-making process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-considerations-when-selecting-a-wordpress-ecommerce-plugin">Considerations when selecting a WordPress eCommerce Plugin</h2>



<p>When selecting a WordPress eCommerce plugin for your website, it is crucial to take into account the type of products you will be offering and the features you require. If your intention is to sell digital products, such as music, eBooks, and photos, it would be beneficial to search for a plugin specifically designed for this type of commerce platform. These applications will enhance your protection against pirated content and provide a more streamlined user experience for potential customers browsing your online marketplace. If you plan to sell physical goods that require shipping, you should select an eCommerce software that is specifically designed for it. If you operate a drop-shipping business, you may require real-time inventory support, securely integrated payment platforms, and scalability features to handle surges in demand or traffic during special occasions. It is crucial to ensure that the chosen WordPress eCommerce solution includes all the necessary tools and additional add-ons for efficient online operations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-requirements-for-operating-an-ecommerce-website">What are the requirements for operating an eCommerce website?</h3>



<p>Choosing the right hosting provider is important for a successful eCommerce website. Your hosting plan must be able to handle the resource demands of an online shop while fulfilling all of your other needs. Some stand-out affordable options are SiteGround and Bluehost; with SSL certificates, dedicated IPs, and support lines, they help tight budgets make sales. For those with more resources, WPEngine, a managed WordPress hosting provider, offers better performance.</p>



<p>After selecting your website host, it&#8217;s time to buy your domain name. This will be the URL used by customers to access your site, so make it memorable and catchy. With these requirements met, you&#8217;re one step closer to launching your own eCommerce website. Congrats!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-five-recommended-ecommerce-plugins-for-wordpress">Five Recommended eCommerce Plugins for WordPress</h2>



<p>Picking the right eCommerce platform for your WordPress site can be tough. Luckily, there are plenty of eCommerce plugins to help. They come in a range of options, from pre-built and easy-to-use to customizable and advanced. These choices fit varying budgets and needs, so keep your use case in mind. This article will explain some of these options:</p>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WooCommerce</a></li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Digital Downloads</a></li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MemberPress</a></li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BigCommerce</a> for Wordpress</li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-shopify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shopify</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive into each!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-woocommerce">1. WooCommerce</h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WooCommerce</a> is the top open-source eCommerce platform for online stores. It&#8217;s a popular WordPress plugin that offers great customization options. Developers prefer it and it&#8217;s now available for specialized hosting solutions, providing better performance and reliability.</p>



<p>In 2015, Automattic acquired WooCommerce, a service for hosting blogs, greatly improving the platform&#8217;s user experience and technology. As a result, the customer base has grown and third-party developers have created many extensions for WooCommerce stores. This, along with a passionate community of supporters, has made WooCommerce a leading eCommerce solution for small business owners and web designers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-of-woocommerce">Benefits of WooCommerce</h4>



<p>Overall, WooCommerce is a great WordPress eCommerce plugin. It has many extensions and themes available, so you can easily add features and customize your design to reflect your brand or message. With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital products like ebooks, music, and software. It&#8217;s a simple way to create an online store with just one plugin.</p>



<p>Additionally, WooCommerce simplifies inventory management by tracking stock levels and assigning a store manager. It also offers great functionality for external or affiliate products, making it easy to include them on your website. This eCommerce plugin has all the features you need to start selling online without any extra plugins.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons-of-using-woocommerce">Cons of Using WooCommerce</h4>



<p>WooCommerce has many options, which can be overwhelming for new users. It takes time to learn how everything works and find suitable add-ons, and some themes work better with the plugin than others. To use WooCommerce fully, you need a theme made for your needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-easy-digital-downloads">2. Easy Digital Downloads</h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)</a> is a user-friendly platform for selling digital products on WordPress. It has simple features and lets you create a highly customized store for your needs. Not only is EDD easy to configure and use but with its continued growth there are now various hosting options out there which have EDD pre-installed so that setting up a store from scratch can be done in no time. Whether you’re selling software, music files, or courses, EDD makes the process much faster by automating the checkout process and other parts of your website’s workflow.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-of-using-easy-digital-downloads">Pros of Using Easy Digital Downloads</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy To Use</strong> – EDD is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to set up a store regardless of their experience with WordPress. This makes it much easier to find the features you need and make sure they are all focused on selling your specific types of products.</li>



<li><strong>Integrations</strong> – EDD also has a lot of great integrations with third-party services such as PayPal and Stripe, making it simple to accept payments on your website. Additionally, EDD integrates with some popular WordPress plugins such as Gravity Forms and WPForms for added functionality.</li>



<li><strong>Multiple Payment Options</strong> – EDD offers a range of payment options, which makes it easier for customers to purchase your products. This includes payments through PayPal, credit cards, and even cryptocurrency.</li>



<li><strong>Extensive Reporting</strong> – EDD also offers extensive reporting options so you can keep an eye on your store’s performance. This will help you make sure that everything is running smoothly and that your store is making money.</li>



<li><strong>Extensions</strong> – There are a range of extensions available which you can use to add additional features to your store. This includes things such as discounts and coupons, customer management tools, and email marketing integrations.</li>



<li><strong>Software Licensing</strong> – EDD also offers software licensing so you can sell products which need to be activated after purchase. This is particularly useful for those who are selling software, as it adds an extra layer of security.</li>



<li><strong>Themes</strong> – EDD also has a range of compatible themes available so you can easily customize the look and feel of your store.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons-of-using-easy-digital-downloads">Cons of Using Easy Digital Downloads</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Physical Goods</strong> – Unfortunately, EDD does not support the sale of physical goods, so if you want to sell anything other than digital items you’ll need to look elsewhere.</li>



<li><strong>No Shipping Options</strong> – Since EDD is focused on digital products, it doesn’t come with any shipping or delivery options built-in. If you want to offer the ability for customers to collect their purchased items in person then this isn’t an option with EDD.</li>



<li><strong>Fewer Add-ons</strong> – EDD has fewer add-ons than WooCommerce does, so it might not be able to offer the same level of customization and features that WooCommerce can.</li>



<li><strong>Limited Support</strong> – Although the documentation for EDD is very comprehensive, the support provided by the developers is limited. This means that if you run into any issues while setting up your store or managing it in the long run, you may not be able to get help right away.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-memberpress">3. MemberPress</h3>



<p><a href="https://memberpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MemberPress</a> is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to help users create and manage subscription services and digital products. With its easy-to-use membership plugin, you can limit access to your content, create coupons and discount codes, handle payment processing, set up recurring payments, and more. It also allows for integration with many other platforms such as WooCommerce. While you might be tempted to jump head first into building your product or service on MemberPress, there are pros and cons that should be considered first.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-of-using-memberpress">Pros of Using MemberPress</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy To Use</strong> – Setting up and managing a store with MemberPress is incredibly easy. The user interface is simple and intuitive, meaning that even those without any technical knowledge should be able to get up and running in no time.</li>



<li><strong>Integration With Other Services</strong> – MemberPress also integrates with many other platforms such as WooCommerce and MailChimp which makes it easier to manage your store and keep in touch with customers.</li>



<li><strong>Powerful Access Rules</strong> – With MemberPress you can easily limit access to your content, giving you full control over who has access and when. This is particularly useful for those selling subscription-based products or services.</li>



<li><strong>Built-in Course Builder</strong> – MemberPress also comes with a built-in course builder so you can easily create online courses for your customers.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons-of-using-memberpress">Cons of Using MemberPress</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Payment Options</strong> – Unfortunately, MemberPress does not offer support for all payment gateways. This means that if you want to use a payment gateway other than Stripe, PayPal, and Authorize.net, then you may have to look elsewhere.</li>



<li><strong>No Physical Product Support </strong>– As with EDD, MemberPress does not support the sale of physical goods. If you’re looking to sell anything other than digital items then you’ll need to look elsewhere.</li>



<li><strong>No Physical Product Support</strong> – MemberPress does not support the sale of physical products, so if you want to sell anything other than digital items then you’ll need to look elsewhere.</li>



<li><strong>No Shopping Cart Feature</strong> – Unlike WooCommerce, MemberPress does not have the ability to add multiple items to a cart before the checkout process starts. Instead, customers will need to purchase each item individually which can lead to more abandoned purchases due to people getting distracted or frustrated.</li>



<li><strong>More Expensive</strong> – Although MemberPress does offer a lot of powerful features, it is more expensive than some other WordPress eCommerce plugins. This could be a dealbreaker for those on a tight budget.</li>



<li><strong>Not Open Source</strong> – Unlike WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads, MemberPress is not an open-source plugin which means that customizing the code to suit your needs could prove difficult.</li>



<li><strong>Yearly Pricing</strong> – One of the biggest drawbacks to MemberPress is that the pricing model is based on yearly subscription. This means that if you want to use the service for a longer period of time, you may end up paying more than you’d like.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-bigcommerce">4. BigCommerce</h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BigCommerce</a> is an eCommerce platform that offers a great solution for businesses looking to integrate their WordPress site with a powerful and scalable eCommerce solution. It has powerful plugins available to extend the functionality of your site while simultaneously keeping pages secure, loading quickly and managing content effectively. It enables easy sign-in, shopping cart system, accounts page and much more with very minimal effort.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-of-using-bigcommerce">Pros of Using BigCommerce</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>High scalability</strong> – BigCommerce is one of the most scalable eCommerce solutions available. It allows you to easily handle large amounts of traffic and orders without crashing or slowing down your website.</li>



<li><strong>Integrated Payment Options</strong> – BigCommerce comes with integrated payment gateway options like PayPal and Stripe which makes it easier to accept payments from customers.</li>

<li><strong>Customer Service</strong> – BigCommerce has an excellent customer service team that is available 24/7 to help you out when you need it. They can help with any technical problems or queries you may have.</li>



<li><strong>No transaction charges</strong> – One of the great advantages of BigCommerce is that it doesn’t charge any transaction fees. This means you can keep more of your profits.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons-of-using-bigcommerce">Cons of Using BigCommerce</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Integrations</strong> – BigCommerce integrates with all the top third-party apps and tools. However, its app store is still growing, and you may not find an integration for some less popular apps.</li>



<li><strong>Yearly Sales Threshold</strong> – Each plan has a sales threshold that must be met annually. Once the threshold is reached, the next plan will be activated. Watch out! As your business expands, so will the price tag.</li>



<li><strong>Pricing</strong> – BigCommerce is one of the more expensive WordPress eCommerce plugins available. Although it offers a lot of features, this may make it too expensive for some users.</li>



<li><strong>Complex Setup</strong> – BigCommerce is a powerful platform and can be quite complex to set up. It may require professional help to ensure you get everything configured correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Not Open Source</strong> – As with many other eCommerce platforms, BigCommerce isn’t open source which means customizing the code and adding features can be difficult.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-shopify">5. Shopify</h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-shopify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shopify</a> is another popular eCommerce platform that provides an easy and efficient way to build an online store. It is a great choice for those who are looking for a comprehensive solution with lots of features, as well as those who need extra help in setting up their store. Shopify also has powerful built-in features such as inventory management, marketing automation and customer segmentation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-of-using-shopify">Pros of Using Shopify</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Super Easy for Beginners</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/shopify-online-store-2/">Shopify is incredibly user-friendly</a>&nbsp;and easy to use even if you’ve never created an online store before.</li>



<li><strong>Supports Both Digital and Physical Goods</strong>&nbsp;– Whether you’re selling physical goods like shirts or digital downloads like music, Shopify can handle it all.</li>



<li><strong>Complete Inventory Management</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify comes with an inventory editor and bulk importer combined with an order tracker which makes managing inventory a breeze.</li>



<li><strong>Payment and Shipping Options</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify offers payment and shipping options that simplify the process for accepting credit cards online and in person. Additionally, their shipping system is integrated with popular providers like USPS, which can streamline your fulfillment process.</li>



<li><strong>Facebook Store and Buyable Pins</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify offers integration with various platforms, including Facebook Store and Buyable Pins on Pinterest, allowing users to create online stores and enable purchasing directly on those platforms.</li>



<li><strong>Wide Range of Apps</strong>&nbsp;– customize your store, add features and expand its functionality with Shopify’s myriad apps. With these apps, you can create unique customer experiences, personalize product recommendations, create loyalty programs, and much more. The Shopify app store provides hundreds of options for you to choose from and with new apps being added regularly, you’ll never run out of ideas!</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons-of-using-shopify">Cons of Using Shopify</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Free Plan</strong>&nbsp;– Unlike some other eCommerce options, there’s no free plan available with Shopify. You’ll have to pay the monthly fee regardless of how much you sell.</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify is a bit more expensive than other eCommerce platforms. The basic plan starts at $29/month, but you’ll want to upgrade for the full features. The higher-tier plans can be quite pricey, and if you need additional features like advanced analytics or abandoned cart recovery, you may have to pay extra for them.</li>



<li><strong>Transaction Fees</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify charges a transaction fee for each sale made on their platform. This can be quite costly if you’re making a lot of sales.</li>



<li><strong>Limited Support</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify provides excellent customer service, but they don’t offer 24/7 support like some other providers do.</li>



<li><strong>No Shipping Discounts</strong>&nbsp;– Shopify doesn’t offer any discounts on shipping rates which means that customers may avoid buying your products.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>



<p>Choosing the right eCommerce plugin for your WordPress site can be a daunting task. There are so many options out there and it can seem overwhelming to decide which will work best for your needs. The plugins listed above are all excellent choices, but the one you choose should depend on the type of store you’re looking to create and the features you need. If you’re looking for a comprehensive solution with lots of features, Shopify is a great choice. However, if you’re looking for an easy setup with fewer features and don’t mind paying transaction fees, then WooCommerce may be the better option. Ultimately, it all comes down to your individual needs and preferences.</p>

<p>In this guide, you&#8217;ll learn how to identify relevant keywords and phrases, craft engaging title tags and meta descriptions, optimize product category pages, and much more. With these tips and tricks, you&#8217;ll be able to build a strong foundation for organic search traffic that will draw customers to your store!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is eCommerce SEO?</h2>



<p>eCommerce SEO is the process of optimizing an online store for organic search engine traffic. What makes it different are the product and category pages. This involves using strategies such as keyword research, content optimization, and link building to improve your products’ visibility in search results.</p>



<p>By targeting relevant keywords in your product descriptions, you can make sure that when customers are searching for products like yours, they will be able to find your eCommerce store quickly and easily.</p>



<p>Additionally, optimizing product category pages with strategic keywords can help draw more customers by providing them with detailed information about the products offered on your site.</p>



<p>eCommerce SEO can also help build brand awareness and trust through creating high-quality content that is both informative and engaging. With the right strategies in place, you can make sure that your eCommerce store is successful at attracting your ideal customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of eCommerce SEO</strong></h3>



<p>One advantage that eCommerce sites have is the number of pages that can be optimized. Besides having a standard home page, about page, and possibly a blog, eCommerce sites also have category and product pages &#8211; that’s a lot of real estate for SEO!</p>



<p>Organic traffic generated from your SEO efforts is consistent, free (besides your labor), and targeted. A marketer’s dream!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Search Engines and Potential Customers</h2>



<p>Optimizing product pages for relevant keywords and phrases can help ensure that your site appears in search engine results pages (SERPs), increasing its visibility and drawing in more ideal visitors.</p>



<p>Creating a user-friendly experience on your website is important as well &#8211; potential customers should be able to easily find what they&#8217;re looking for without being overwhelmed by too much content or features.</p>



<p>By taking advantage of the various tools available, you can make sure that your eCommerce site stands out from the competition and draws in new customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Search Engines Work</strong></h3>



<p>Search engines are constantly evolving, but their core purpose remains the same: to provide users with the most relevant and useful information possible. The process begins when a user types in a query, which is then fed into an algorithm that evaluates web pages and ranks them accordingly. This algorithm takes into account factors such as the page&#8217;s content, its relevance to the query, its loading speed, and how often it is updated.</p>



<p>Other factors such as backlinks from other websites can also affect ranking. Search engines use this data to create a list of results for users &#8211; those at the top of the list are generally considered to be the most relevant and helpful for fulfilling their needs. By understanding how search engines work and taking steps to optimize your website accordingly, you can ensure that your eCommerce site will rank higher in SERPs and draw more shoppers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Your Target Audience</strong></h3>



<p>Understanding your target audience is key to success in eCommerce SEO. Knowing who you are targeting and <strong>what they are looking for</strong> allows you to tailor your copy and website design to their needs.</p>



<p>Since you’re a marketer, you’ve probably already got buyer personas for your ideal customers. If not, you’ll need to start there &#8211; it’s the only way to understand what they’re searching for! To get inspiration, start doing some searching of your own. Try typing in terms related to your product offerings on Google, Pinterest, and Amazon to see what people are <strong>actually</strong> searching. Plus, you’ll get further inspiration for keywords you can target.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Internal Links &amp; Product Category Pages</h2>



<p>Internal links are crucial for effective eCommerce SEO. Not only do they help improve the user experience, but they also boost your rankings in search engine results.</p>



<p>Adding descriptive anchor text to the internal links will help search engines understand what each page is about and how it relates to other pages on the site.</p>



<p>Be sure to include outbound links to other websites or blogs in your product category pages as this will help show that you have authority in the industry and can provide helpful resources for customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Optimizing Product Category Pages for SEO</strong></h3>



<p>Optimizing category pages correctly will help customers find what they need quickly, and demonstrate to search engines that your website is organized and relevant.</p>



<p>To achieve this, optimize your navigation and filtering links. Having organized inventory sorted by item type is not only intuitive for shoppers, but also indicates to search engines how relevant your site is to a particular product.</p>



<p>Make sure all pages are properly optimized for keywords related to the product or category being discussed. By taking the time to optimize product category pages for SEO, eCommerce websites can ensure their rankings remain high and customers have a positive experience on their website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ranking Factors &amp; Target Keywords</h2>



<p>To ensure your website reaches the top of search engine results, carefully select relevant keywords that accurately reflect the products you offer, but also what your potential customers are <strong>actually</strong> searching for. Make sure to include these keywords throughout your website’s content in a natural way.</p>



<p>Other important ranking factors include increasing website speed, improving user experience, and building quality backlinks from authoritative websites. Mobile optimization is also essential as more people are using smartphones and tablets to shop online.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Identifying Relevant Keywords &amp; Phrases</strong></h3>



<p>Identifying relevant keywords and phrases is crucial to successful eCommerce SEO. You can use <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/14207073-the-beginners-guide-to-keyword-research-for-ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyword research</a> tools such as Ahrefs.com, Moz Keyword Explorer, or Hubspot’s SEO tool to find words related to your products that your customers are genuinely typing into search engines.</p>



<p>Once you have identified several potential keywords, create a list of relevant ones that accurately reflect your products. It is also important to include long-tail keywords for more specific searches, such as “men’s black dress shoes.”</p>



<p>These keywords need to be featured in content throughout your website including product pages, category pages, blog posts, and landing pages. By taking the time to identify relevant keywords and phrases, eCommerce businesses can ensure they are targeting the right audience with their SEO efforts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Writing Quality Product Descriptions for eCommerce SEO</h2>



<p>Product descriptions are additional SEO real estate that non-eCommerce sites don’t have! They should be written in an engaging way that highlights the features and benefits of the product, while also containing relevant keywords that are related to your product. This helps ensure that potential customers can find your product on search engine results pages.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that customers may not have a lot of time to read through detailed descriptions, so make sure to get your point across quickly and effectively. Making use of bulleted lists, charts, and short paragraphs can help users take in the information, while allowing you to write copy for search engines.</p>



<p>Include internal links within the content of each description to help users navigate between different products and categories. Use this space to make <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/best-shopify-apps-for-upselling-and-cross-selling/">cross-selling</a> suggestions!</p>



<p>It’s also important to be consistent with your messaging across all platforms – from website product descriptions to social selling listings – as this will help strengthen your brand’s identity and build trust with potential customers. By writing quality product descriptions and keeping them consistent across all platforms, you can improve visibility on organic search engine results pages and drive more sales for your business.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-b-testing">What is A/B Testing?</h2>



<p>A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two different versions of a webpage to determine which one performs better. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that can help you <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/wordpress-performance-optimization/">optimize your website</a> and improve user experience. However, many WordPress users are not familiar with A/B testing or don&#8217;t know how to do it effectively on their sites.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to increase your website&#8217;s conversion rate and improve user engagement, A/B testing is a great place to start. In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to do effective A/B testing with WordPress, step-by-step. You&#8217;ll learn what AB testing is, why it&#8217;s important, and how to set up and run your own AB tests on your WordPress website. So, let&#8217;s get started!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elements-you-should-be-a-b-testing-on-your-wordpress-site">Elements You Should be A/B Testing on Your WordPress Site</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-headlines">Headlines</h3>



<p>The headline is the first thing visitors see when they land on your site. A/B testing different headlines can help you determine which one resonates best with your audience. Try different variations, such as longer vs. shorter headlines, questions vs. statements, and emotional vs. factual.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calls-to-action-ctas">Calls to Action (CTAs)</h3>



<p>CTAs are critical to the success of your site. A/B test different versions of your CTA buttons, such as color, size, and text. You can also test the placement of the buttons to see if they perform better in different locations on your site.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graphics">Graphics</h3>



<p>Images can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of your site. A/B test different types of images, such as product images vs. lifestyle images, and see which ones perform better. You can also test the size and placement of images to see if they have an impact on your conversion rates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forms">Forms</h3>



<p>Forms are a crucial element of your site, especially if you&#8217;re running an e-commerce store or collecting leads. A/B test the length and complexity of your forms to see if they affect your conversion rates. You can also test different form fields to see which ones are necessary and which ones can be removed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-navigation">Navigation</h3>



<p>The navigation of your site can impact how long visitors stay on your site and how many pages they visit. A/B test different navigation menus and see which one performs better. You can also test the placement of the menu and the number of items in the menu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-perform-a-b-testing-with-wordpress">How To Perform A/B Testing With WordPress</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-define-your-objective">Step 1: Define Your Objective</h3>



<p>Before starting an A/B test, it&#8217;s important to define your objective. What do you want to achieve with the test? Do you want to increase conversions, clicks, or engagement? Once you have a clear objective, you can create two versions of the same page, each with a different element to test.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-2-choose-an-a-b-testing-tool">Step 2: Choose an A/B Testing Tool</h3>



<p>There are several A/B testing tools available for WordPress, such as Google Optimize, Nelio A/B Testing, or Convert. Choose a tool that suits your needs and install it on your WordPress site. Most tools offer a user-friendly interface that allows you to create, launch, and track experiments easily.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-3-create-your-variations">Step 3: Create Your Variations</h3>



<p>Using the A/B testing tool, create two versions of the same page with a different element to test. For example, you can test different headlines, images, call-to-action buttons, or page layouts. Ensure that the variations are distinct and measurable so that you can track their performance accurately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-4-launch-the-experiment">Step 4: Launch the Experiment</h3>



<p>Once you have created your variations, launch the experiment using the A/B testing tool. The tool will randomly show each version to a portion of your website visitors, and track their behavior. Ensure that the experiment runs long enough to gather sufficient data to make an informed decision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-5-analyze-the-results">Step 5: Analyze the Results</h3>



<p>After the experiment has run for a sufficient period, analyze the results using the A/B testing tool. Look at the data to determine which version performed better in terms of your objective. If one version outperformed the other, implement the changes on your website permanently. If the results are inconclusive, consider running another experiment with different variations.</p>

<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form"></div><img decoding="async" width="30px" height="30px" class="ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solarSystem.png"/><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What is Online Store 2.0?</h2></div></div>



<p>Shopify Online Store 2.0 is the latest version of Shopify’s e-commerce platform, which aims to provide a more customizable and flexible online store experience. This version includes several new features and improvements that allow merchants to create a more unique and personalized online store that better reflects their brand.</p>



<p>One of the most significant changes in Shopify Online Store 2.0 is the introduction of a new theme architecture called Online Store Design. This new architecture allows merchants to have more control over the design and layout of their online store. With Online Store Design, merchants can create custom templates, sections, and blocks that can be used across their store, making it easier to achieve a consistent look and feel.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It overhauled the theme architecture to provide increased functionality for developers and enhanced flexible store content for content managers. It ultimately means more versatility with less dependence on a development team for store content management.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Christi Carnahan, Shopify Operations Manager, Jorban</cite></blockquote>



<p>Another new feature in Shopify Online Store 2.0 is the addition of metafields. Metafields are custom fields that can be added to products, orders, and other objects in Shopify. This feature allows merchants to add additional data to their products, such as size charts or care instructions, making it easier for customers to make informed purchases.</p>



<p>Shopify Online Store 2.0 also includes improvements to its performance and speed. This version includes a new rendering engine that allows pages to load faster, which can improve the overall user experience for customers.</p>



<p>For developers, Shopify Online Store 2.0 offers new APIs and tools that allow for more customization and integration with third-party apps and services. This new version also includes a new development environment called Shopify CLI, which allows developers to build and test Shopify apps more efficiently.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upgraded-theme-editor-more-efficiencies-less-headaches">Upgraded Theme Editor = More Efficiencies, Less Headaches</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The new theme editor is more intuitive and easier to navigate thanks to the new tree-view display. The ability to hide or display sections with one click and drag and drop functionality to restructure the overall layout provide content managers with the ability to quickly provide a fresh view for users.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Christi Carnahan, Shopify Operations Manager, Jorban</cite></blockquote>



<p>This incredible update promises a much more user-friendly experience, making it easier than ever to manage and create templates. With all available features packed conveniently in one place, you no longer have to waste time searching around when making updates or changes to your store. Enjoy a frictionless journey as you create and edit your site – make the most of Shopify’s boldest upgrade yet!</p>



<p>Shopify often changes its theme editor, but this new upgrade is the most significant. The new editor is user-friendly, with all features and functionalities in one central place, making site navigation and editing easier. This saves time when making changes or updates to your store.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sections-everywhere-more-customization-with-less-code">Sections Everywhere = More Customization with Less Code</h3>



<p>Sections Everywhere is a feature introduced by Shopify that allows businesses to easily customize their online stores by adding and moving sections on any page. This feature is available for all Shopify themes and allows businesses to create unique and customized pages for their online stores.</p>



<p>Sections Everywhere allows businesses to add sections to any page, including the homepage, product pages, and collection pages. These sections can be customized and moved around the page using a drag-and-drop interface. This makes it easy for businesses to create unique pages that are tailored to their specific needs.</p>



<p>One of the main benefits of Sections Everywhere is that it allows businesses to create customized pages without the need for coding. This means that businesses can create unique pages that are tailored to their specific needs without having to hire a developer. Additionally, the drag-and-drop interface makes it easy for businesses to make changes to their pages quickly and easily.</p>



<p>Another benefit of Sections Everywhere is that it allows businesses to create a consistent look and feel across their entire online store. By using the same sections on multiple pages, businesses can create a cohesive look that helps to reinforce their brand identity.</p>



<p>To use Sections Everywhere, businesses simply need to open the Shopify Theme Editor and select the page they want to customize. From there, they can add and customize sections using the drag-and-drop interface.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-metafields-better-product-management">Metafields = Better Product Management</h3>



<p>Metafields are a powerful tool for customizing your Shopify online store and providing a better shopping experience for your customers. By adding relevant metafields to your products, collections, orders, and pages, you can improve searchability, streamline fulfillment, and provide more detailed product information. With the Shopify Online Store 2.0 update, it’s easier than ever to use metafields in your store, so start exploring how they can benefit your business today.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The biggest lift is the addition of a file picker within metafields to allow content managers to add product-specific media to pages where they previously required assistance from a developer to hard code the assets.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improved-site-performance-better-user-experience">Improved Site Performance = Better User Experience</h3>



<p>With Online Store 2.0, Shopify has optimized the code and improved the performance of its themes. This means that your store will load faster, providing a better user experience for your customers.

Along with the aforementioned benefits of Online Store 2.0, updating and maintaining apps has also improved – meaning Shopify stores can continue to provide a totally personalized and immersive experience for their shoppers. Think: social commerce integrations, custom content, and&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/best-shopify-apps-for-upselling-and-cross-selling/">upselling and cross selling</a>&nbsp;to name a few. Here are some of the ecommerce trends to watch out for in 2023:</p>



<ol>
<li>Voice Commerce</li>



<li>Social Commerce</li>



<li>Personalization</li>



<li>Augmented Reality</li>



<li>Sustainability</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-voice-commerce">Voice Commerce</h3>



<p>With the increasing popularity of voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home, voice commerce is expected to grow rapidly. By 2023, it’s predicted that <a href="https://intellias.com/how-will-utilities-engage-with-virtual-assistants/#:~:text=It%20is%20predicted%20that%2055,home%20systems%20with%20vital%20functionality." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">55% of households will have a smart speaker</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/voice-shopping-estimated-to-hit-40-billion-across-u-s-and-u-k-by-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voice commerce sales are expected to reach $40 billion</a>. This growth will be driven by the convenience of voice shopping, especially for repeat purchases.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-commerce">Social Commerce</h3>



<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest are becoming more integrated with ecommerce. In 2023, social commerce is expected to reach $600 billion, with more brands leveraging social media to sell their products. Social media platforms are also introducing new features like in-app checkout, making it easier for consumers to purchase products without leaving the app.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personalization">Personalization</h3>



<p>Personalization has been a trend in ecommerce for a while, but in 2023, it will become even more important. With the abundance of data available, brands will be able to create more personalized experiences for their customers. This includes personalized product recommendations, targeted promotions, and customized content.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-augmented-reality">Augmented Reality</h3>



<p>Augmented reality (AR) is becoming more prevalent in ecommerce, allowing consumers to visualize products in their own environment before making a purchase. By 2023, it’s predicted that 100 million consumers will shop using AR technology. This technology will also help reduce returns, as consumers will have a better idea of what they’re purchasing.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sustainability">Sustainability</h3>



<p>Consumers are becoming more conscious of their environmental impact, and this will continue to influence ecommerce in 2023. Brands that prioritize sustainability will have a competitive advantage, as consumers are willing to pay more for eco-friendly products. This includes using sustainable materials, reducing waste, and implementing green practices in their supply chain.</p>



<p>In conclusion, ecommerce is evolving rapidly, and brands that stay ahead of the trends will have a competitive advantage. By leveraging new technologies like Shopify Online Store 2.0, and prioritizing personalization and sustainability, brands can create a more engaging and meaningful shopping experience for their customers, which will lead to growth in 2023.</p>

<p>A well-designed website can mean the difference between customers trusting your business and them quickly navigating away. Website redesigns are a popular choice amongst businesses looking to create an eye-catching and user-friendly experience for their customers.</p>



<p>It’s not just about making a website look pretty, though; website redesigns can change the way that visitors interact with your site and make it easier for search engines to find you. In this article, we will explore some of the benefits of website redesign so that you can decide if it’s time to redo your site!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-benefits-of-website-redesign">5 Benefits of Website Redesign</h2>



<ol>
<li>Improve Your Brand Perception</li>



<li>Enhance User Experience</li>



<li>Increase Conversions &amp; Sales</li>



<li>Boost Performance &amp; SEO</li>



<li>Upgrade Internal Functionality</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefit-1-improve-your-brand-perception">Benefit #1: Improve Your Brand Perception&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When done correctly, a website redesign can positively influence how your target audience perceives and engages with your brand. It also offers a great opportunity to update existing visual elements to better reflect your current goals. Redesigning your website can help make sure that it looks more modern and professional while helping you stand out from the competition.</p>



<p>By keeping user experience at the forefront of design/strategy decisions, you will be able to showcase your value proposition effectively, which leads to building trust with customers and higher conversion rates. All these key benefits make website redesign a worthwhile investment for any business looking to establish or enhance its online presence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-update-align-your-brand-messaging-positioning">Update/Align Your Brand Messaging &amp; Positioning</h3>



<p>Your website should effectively communicate the core values and services of your company. Make sure to take into consideration any changes in the market, customer perceptions, audience needs, or other factors that may influence how you communicate with them through your website design. Knowing how people currently interact with your website can help guide you here. What’s working now, and where can you improve?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-concentrate-on-visual-design-aesthetic">Concentrate On Visual Design Aesthetic</h3>



<p>Your brand perception will largely be attributed to how visually appealing your site looks without sacrificing usability across any range of browsers/devices/viewports (desktop or mobile).</p>



<p>To enhance visual appeal while still retaining ideal levels of usability opt for easy-to-understand typography, creative imagery, and clear calls to action (CTAs). This isn’t to say you can’t wow your audience. An example of a site that does this well is <a href="https://www.hitt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HITT</a>. While their site has a lot of design to it, it’s still very clear to the user how to navigate it – leaving a lasting impression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefit-2-enhance-your-site-s-user-experience">Benefit #2: Enhance Your Site’s User Experience</h2>



<p>Redesigning a website is a great way to better the user experience. A new design can make a website more accessible. Additionally, redesigning your site can help ensure that it remains competitive even as trends in design evolve over time. By investing in website redesigns on a regular basis (the average&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-lifespan/">lifespan of a website is 2 years, 4 months</a>. Whereas sites built by Jorbanoutperform the average lifespan by more than 60%), businesses can ensure that their sites remain appealing and up-to-date.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improve-navigation-structure">Improve Navigation &amp; Structure</h3>



<p>The layout of a website often determines whether or not visitors stick around to learn about what you do and why they should work with you. Invest in a clean and intuitive navigation system to make it easier for users to move from one page to another.</p>



<p>Additionally, use responsive web design techniques to ensure visitors have access to all of the same content regardless of which device they’re using (desktop or mobile device).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focus-on-usability-accessibility">Focus on Usability &amp; Accessibility</h3>



<p>Usability is important when designing websites—especially when creating an immersive online experience for potential customers. It’s also important that sites are accessible by all users regardless of ability level.</p>



<p>Be mindful of color contrast, font styles and sizes, alternative text tags for images so they can be read by screen readers, and other assistive technology devices – all features considered best practices within web <a href="https://accessibe.com/a/pp4fivl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accessibility standards today</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefit-3-increase-conversions-and-sales">Benefit #3: Increase Conversions and Sales</h2>



<p>With a website redesign, you have the opportunity to align your site’s user experience (UX) with customer journeys. You also have the chance to create landing pages tailored specifically to different stages of the buying process.</p>



<p>Additionally, consider optimizing your website for specific goals like increased sign-ups, demo requests, leads, or orders. A well-designed website can be pivotal in helping you reach success in those key areas.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-effective-content-as-part-of-website-redesign">Create Effective Content as Part of Website Redesign</h3>



<p>Content has become an essential element of successful web design. People use search engines for answers, which means content must be created with keyword-rich phrases optimized for search engines if you want organic traffic from Google or Bing.</p>



<p>Content should also be written in an engaging way that attracts potential buyers who have already done research on their own volition. The content should further educate readers on the product or service being offered and include calls to action that encourage visitors to take the next desired step in the customer journey.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-for-conversions-with-clear-calls-to-action">Design For Conversions With Clear Calls-To-Action</h3>



<p>No matter how attractive or informative the design may be, visitors won’t become customers without clear CTAs prompting them forward through the sales process with confidence – i.e., buttons like “learn more,” “get started now,” “buy now,” etc…</p>



<p>Make it as easy as possible for potential customers to take action.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measure-results-after-going-live">Measure Results After Going Live</h3>



<p>You’ll use your current site’s metrics as your baseline. From there, you’ll set goals for specific KPIs you want to target for the new site (e.g. increase the number of orders each month by 8%). Since during the design process you had these goals in mind, after launch you should track your results to measure success and continuous improvement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefit-4-boost-site-performance-and-seo">Benefit #4: Boost Site Performance and SEO</h2>



<p>A website redesign can be used to improve a website’s performance and its ability to attract organic traffic. A redesign involves restructuring the existing webpages and design elements, adding (or removing) features, creating new pages and content, and improving the overall user experience. Additionally, by improving the website speed loading times and reducing bounce rates with better navigation structure, site performance will increase as well as search engine visibility. All together this will significantly&nbsp;<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-redesign-a-website-without-losing-seo/">improve your website’s SEO</a>&nbsp;rankings in search engines like Google.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-optimize-load-times">Optimize Load Times</h3>



<p>Page load times are critical because it affects how quickly information is delivered on a web page—which then affects user interaction with the said page(s). Additionally, reductive loading times generally help increase search engine rankings making such efforts both beneficial from an SEO standpoint plus from a user perspective potentially allowing them greater access whenever seeking out needed information quickly &amp; efficiently</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefit-5-upgrade-internal-functionality">Benefit #5: Upgrade Internal Functionality</h2>



<p>Now is the time to upgrade the internal functionality of your website. What are the current bottlenecks in your website management? Do you have common complaints from your employees about a particular process?</p>



<p>Going through a website redesign project will help identify areas that are bogging you down. This will allow you to increase the efficiency of your marketing department, which means they can spend more time on ROI-producing activities and less time on logistics.</p>



<p>An example of this could be setting up a uniform structure for organizing pages in your CMS like WordPress. Or, making sure you’re using the right CMS in the first place. Clearly, this will vary per business and website!</p>
