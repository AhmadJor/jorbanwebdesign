Google Analytics makes it easy to track this data and get insight into your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can better understand your site\u2019s popularity by tracking how many unique users visit your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This information can help you decide how to market your site and what content to focus on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can track how long each user spends on your site and what pages they visit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This information can help you understand the most popular content and how engaging your website is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If users spend a lot of time on certain pages, you\u2019re likely providing good value to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if users leave your site quickly, you may need to rethink your content strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bounce Rates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bounce rates are one of the most important metrics you can track with Google Analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high bounce rate indicates that people leave your website after viewing only one page. This can signify that your website isn\u2019t providing the best user experience or that your content isn\u2019t engaging enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re seeing a high bounce rate, it\u2019s important to take a closer look at your website and see what you can do to improve it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may need to rethink your design or ensure your content is interesting and relevant to your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sessions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sessions is a metric that Google Analytics tracks to help you understand how long users spend on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking how many sessions each user has, you can get an idea of how engaged they are with your content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If users only visit your site once, they\u2019re likely not interested in what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Total Sessions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This refers to how often users have visited your site over a certain period. This important metric can help you understand how engaged visitors are with your content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this number is low, it may be time to rethink how you\u2019re providing value to your audience and make changes accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Average Sessions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric can help track how often users return to your website. If users only visit a few times, your site may not be as valuable to them as it could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if they return frequently and spend a lot of time on your site, they are likely finding value in what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Percentage of New Sessions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>New sessions indicate how many users are visiting your website for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a high percentage of users are new, this can be a sign that you need to improve your site\u2019s visibility and marketing efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher percentage of returning users may signify good engagement with your content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pages per Session<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The page-per-session metric lets you know how many pages each user views during a single session on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This information can help you identify how interested users are in your content and how engaged they are with your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, pages per session can measure the length of time users stay on your website, which is an important indicator of how valuable your site is to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page Views<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1025\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35016\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Page-Views-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you add Google Analytics to WordPress, you can see how many page views your website gets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is valuable information, as it can help you determine your website\u2019s popularity and whether it\u2019s worth investing in further marketing efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if you\u2019re running any ads on your site, you can track their success by comparing the number of page views to the number of clicks on the ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Goal Completed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Goal Completed is a metric that Google Analytics tracks to help you understand how well your website performs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric tells you how often users have completed a goal you\u2019ve set for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can track various goals, such as filling out a form, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking how many users complete your goals, you can know how effectively your website achieves its objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If few users are completing your goals, it may be time to rethink your strategy and change accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, if many users are completing your goals, you\u2019re likely doing something right and should continue doing what you\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Steps To Set Up Your Own Google Analytics<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re running a WordPress site, there are two ways to set up Google Analytics. You can either use a plugin or do it manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go the plugin route, we recommend using our Google Analytics for the WordPress plugin. It\u2019s easy to use and has all the features you need to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Important Note<\/strong>: You\u2019ll need a Google account to use Google Analytics for your website. You can create one for free if you don\u2019t have one already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have a Google account, head to the Google Analytics sign-up page and follow the prompts to create an account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second step, you\u2019ll be asked to provide basic information about your website, including the website name, URL, and time zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve completed the required fields, click \u201cCreate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, head to the analytics Dashboard and select \u201cWeb\u201d as your platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to set up a data stream, which is just a source of data from a website or app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you\u2019ll need to fill in some required fields and click \u201cCreate stream.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will provide you with a measurement ID, a string of characters that you\u2019ll use to send your website\u2019s tracking data to Google Analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to keep the Stream Key information open in another tab, just in case you need it to connect the plugin to Google Analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adding Google Analytics via a Plugin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re running a WordPress site, the easiest way to add Google Analytics is by using a plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Google Analytics for WordPress plugin makes it easy to get started. The plugin is easy to use and has all the features you need to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add the plugin, head to your WordPress Dashboard and select \u201cPlugins\u201d from the menu on the left. Then, click \u201cAdd New.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Type \u201cGoogle Analytics for WordPress\u201d in the search bar and hit Enter. The plugin will appear in the search results, so click \u201cInstall Now.\u201d Once it\u2019s installed, click \u201cActivate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the plugin is activated, you\u2019ll need to enter your Google Analytics information. To do this, select \u201cSettings\u201d from the menu on the left and then click \u201cGoogle Analytics.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Google Analytics section, enter your measurement ID and Stream Key. You can find this information in the Stream Key tab of your Google Analytics account. Click \u201cSave Changes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Make updating your Google Analytics plugins a regular part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-website-maintenance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Website Maintenance<\/a> process.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adding Google Analytics via Manual Setup<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add Google Analytics manually, you\u2019ll need to create a tracking code and insert it into your website\u2019s HTML. This code will send data to Google Analytics about how users interact with your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the tracking code, head to the Google Analytics website and sign in. Select \u201cAdmin\u201d in the top menu and click \u201cTracking Code.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under \u201cWeb Site Tracking,\u201d click \u201cGlobal Site Tag (gtag.js).\u201d A box will appear with some code in it. Copy this code and paste it into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll need to add the tracking code to your website\u2019s HTML. To do this, open the HTML file for your website and look for the tag. Paste the code before the tag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re using a content management system (CMS) such as WordPress, you may be able to add the code by going to Settings &gt; General and adding it to the \u201cHeader\u201d field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to save your changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Conclusion<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Analytics is an excellent tool for tracking metrics about your website\u2019s traffic and performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding how people use your site, you can ensure that your potential customers and audiences have the best chance to see what they want and you can help guide them through a buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Google Analytics can also help you track conversions and other key metrics that can help you improve your website\u2019s overall performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Google Analytics is a valuable tool to help you get the most out of your website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you know how to add Google Analytics to your WordPress website?
