What difference is there between a landing page and a homepage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does each type fit into your business, and more importantly, can you use both of them simultaneously for your business?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All good questions!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive right in and take a look at what those differences are and which is right for your business.

Number of Web Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable difference between landing pages and websites, in general, is the number of web pages they have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are just single pages of information. Where everything needed to be shared is found in one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites typically have several pages and a navigation system. This is due to the number of pages included on a website, and navigation needs to be straightforward to use for users to navigate the website\u2019s web pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll often see a navigation bar at the top or along the side of a website with different sections labeled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it easier for users to find what they\u2019re looking for on a website with lots of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if someone were looking for information on products offered by a company, they would click on the \u201cProducts\u201d page instead of having to scroll through the entire website to find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, websites have multiple pages, while landing pages only have one, and websites need straightforward navigation so users can easily find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Purpose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While both have their unique advantages, in the end, websites and landing pages serve the same purpose: to share information that will make potential customers purchase your product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, landing pages and websites have different methods of achieving that purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are typically single pages with critical information designed to keep users on the page until they decide to make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, websites are usually several pages with information split up based on what makes sense for the company\u2019s website navigation system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which is better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, it depends on the business\u2019s goals and needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are great for businesses with a single product or service, as they can provide all the critical information about that product or service on one page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a website may be a better option if a business has multiple products or services, as it can provide more detailed information about each one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, their differences are more complex. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what landing pages and websites are and if they fit into your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div

class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Landing Pages<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s take a look at landing pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Exactly Are Landing Pages?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/What-Exactly-Are-Landing-Pages-.jpg\" alt=\"What Exactly Are Landing Pages\" class=\"wp-image-33837\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are stand-alone pages designed with a specific goal or purpose in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common goals are related to marketing, advertising, or lead generation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you may have clicked on an ad that brought you to a landing page promoting a product that is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company wants you to sign up for their email list so they can notify you when the product launches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a typical use of a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/landing-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">landing page design<\/a> is to promote something that is not yet available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other times, businesses use landing pages to promote a specific product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will include pricing, images, videos, and testimonials on the page, so the user has everything they need to decide and take action, such as buy now, sign up, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running any online business, it\u2019s essential to have at least a few well-designed landing pages to capture leads and convert them into customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s Their Purpose?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A landing page is a web page that allows you to achieve a specific goal that you have set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be to increase awareness of a new product or service or to increase sales of a specific product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the purpose, every landing page must have one vital element: a Call-to-action (CTA) that results in the end goal of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, what\u2019s the point of having a fantastic landing page if there are no CTA driving users to convert?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you want to increase sales of a new product, your CTA might be \u201cBuy Now\u201d or \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div

class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Websites<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a website is a series of connected web pages that share information with users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Exactly Is a Website?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/What-Exactly-Is-a-Website-.jpg\" alt=\"What Exactly Is a Website\" class=\"wp-image-33838\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s like an online brochure for your business, describing every aspect of your products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like an actual brochure, a website needs to be well-designed and easy to read if you want people to stick around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great website is like a one-stop shop for potential customers or users and can help you convert leads into customers or subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s Their Purpose?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A website\u2019s purpose is twofold:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>To break up much information without overwhelming the user<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>To have different sections of content with other goals and purposes depending on the target audience and the web page\u2019s end goal<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, each page on the website might have a lower conversion rate than a landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the goal of a web page might be to showcase a new product or get people to sign-up for an email list, but not do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You wouldn\u2019t want your homepage to try and do too many things at once \u2014 it\u2019s better to have a focused purpose that matches the user\u2019s needs and drive them towards that goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, they\u2019ll get confused and bounce away faster than you can say \u201cwebsite.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal of every website is to leave users with a manageable amount of information and provide them with an easy way to navigate toward what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div

class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Which Is Better: Landing Pages or a Website?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no easy answer as to whether landing pages or websites are better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you should have a website, landing page, or both depends on your specific needs and goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is a way to go if you want to build a long-term brand with many different types of content and features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019re trying to drive traffic to one specific offer or product, then a landing page might be all you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s always the option of having both!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which One Should I Pick?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Which-One-Should-I-Pick-.jpg\" alt=\"Which One Should I Pick\" class=\"wp-image-33839\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The important thing when deciding between the two is to figure out what\u2019s right for your business. Ask yourself some questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What are your goals?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Who is your target audience?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What kind of content do you want to create?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have answers to these questions, you\u2019ll be able to decide which route is best for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things To Consider About Landing Pages vs a Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to think about when deciding whether to build a website or a landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, websites are great for giving people an overview of what you do and providing lots of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, landing pages are designed to persuade people to take a specific action, like signing up for a newsletter or buying a product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which should you choose? Here are some factors to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequency of Redesigns<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only plan on making changes to your online presence every few years, then a website might be the better option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites require more initial work than landing pages, but they are easier to update sporadically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a landing page might be a better fit if you like to experiment with new designs and features constantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are easier to create and revise, so you can make as many changes as possible without taxing your resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Beware of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/biggest-website-redesign-mistakes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website redesign mistakes<\/a>, you want to redesign your website to better serve your potential customers with helpful content and updates!<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Resources<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a large team of designers and developers at your disposal? Building and improving a website might be the right choice for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have few resources, then simplifying your online presence with a landing page might be the way to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages require fewer human resources to create and maintain, so they\u2019re a good option if you work with limited resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hoping To Build Long-term Relationships?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is beneficial for building relationships with your customers that will last for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites provide more opportunities for interaction and connection than landing pages do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a website, you can include features like blog posts, forums, and customer testimonials that will help you connect with your customers on a deeper level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all you\u2019re looking for is a quick transaction, a landing page might be all you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Final Thoughts<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the verdict?
