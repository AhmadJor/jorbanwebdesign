Make sure your page reflects the character of your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a fun and friendly company, ensure those characteristics come across on your page. If your company is more serious, keep your page\u2019s tone professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some companies like to use humor on their About Us pages, but be careful with this approach. If done wrong, it can come across as try-hard or unprofessional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only use humor if it fits well with your brand voice and if you\u2019re confident that you can pull it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add Some Calls-to-Action<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Add-Some-Calls-to-Action-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Add Some Calls to Action\" class=\"wp-image-33445\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your About Us page is one of the essential pages on your website \u2014 it\u2019s where customers go to learn more about your company and what you offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not take advantage of this opportunity by adding some calls-to-action (CTAs) to your About Us page?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding CTAs to your About Us page can help increase conversions by giving customers a clear next step to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you could add a CTA to contact you or sign up for your email list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that your CTAs are relevant to your target audience and that they\u2019re placed strategically and tastefully on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share Your Values<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your About Us page is an excellent way to share your company values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These values will guide your customers and help them understand what you stand for as a business. Make sure to include them on your About Us page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been in business for a while, mention it on your About Us page. This can help build trust with potential customers and show that you\u2019re a reputable company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can include information about how long you\u2019ve been in business or highlight some of your significant accomplishments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to build trust with potential customers is to talk about the clients you\u2019ve helped in the past. This shows that you have experience working with businesses like theirs and know how to deliver results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve helped big-name clients or completed significant projects, mention it on your About Us page or link to a dedicated page on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34882\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page.png 500w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page-24x24.png 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/deAnna-klein-news-page-48x48.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Your About Us page copy needs to be customer-focused to be effective.
