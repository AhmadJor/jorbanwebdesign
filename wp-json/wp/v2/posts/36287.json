Do you want them to sign up for a newsletter, download a white paper, or make a purchase?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever it is, be sure that your goal is clear before you begin designing your page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal will dictate the rest of the design process, so it is important to get it right from the start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Copy and Images<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Copy-and-Images-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Copy and Images\" class=\"wp-image-33218\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Copy is the next important element to consider. The headline and body copy should be clear and concise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your visitors should be able to understand what you are offering and why they need it without having to read through a lot of text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for images, it is important to use <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-design-standards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">high-quality visuals that complement the copy<\/a>. The images should help to tell the story and convey the message of your landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Product Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are selling a product, it is important to include all of the relevant information on your landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes things like pricing, features, benefits, and even testimonials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more information you can provide, the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you want to persuade your visitors to take action, and providing them with as much information as possible will help to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reviews and Social Proof<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Reviews-and-Social-Proof-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Reviews and Social Proof\" class=\"wp-image-33240\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-use-testimonials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reviews and social proof<\/a> are also important elements to include on your landing page. If you have customer testimonials, be sure to showcase them prominently. This is because people trust other people&#8217;s opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviews can help to build trust and credibility with potential customers. You can also include things like badges or logos from well-known publications if you have been featured in any.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Offer a Special Discount or Free Trial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to persuade people to take action is to offer a special discount or free trial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are selling a product, you can offer a percentage off the regular price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if you are offering a service, you can give people the first month for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People love freebies, so this is a great way to get people to take action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simplicity is Key<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing to keep in mind is that simplicity is key. Your landing page should be easy to understand and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There should be no distractions and the visitor should be able to find what they are looking for easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your landing page is too complicated, people will likely leave without taking any action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overall Goal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to make sure that you have everything you need on your landing page in order to achieve your goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Double-check that your copy is persuasive, your images are high-quality, and that you have included any relevant information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, be sure to keep things simple and easy to understand. If you do all of these things, you will be well on your way to creating an effective landing page design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Examples of Fantastic Landing Pages<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/d\/designhost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Airbnb<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Airbnb-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Airbnb\" class=\"wp-image-33219\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Airbnb landing page does a great job of explaining the benefits of hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also provides clear instructions on how to get started, and if you have any questions, there are plenty of resources available, including a FAQ section, helpful guides, and even an option to contact customer support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/blockliving.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Block Living<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Block-Living-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Block Living\" class=\"wp-image-33220\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Living&#8217;s landing page is another well designed example.
