Think of them like news stories or blog entries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts provide a platform for content creators and bloggers to share their knowledge and stories with their readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are typically updated regularly and display timestamps that allow visitors to know exactly when the post was published.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts are also organized into categories and tags to make them easier to find.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pages typically contain static information that doesn\u2019t change very often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don\u2019t have timestamps associated with them; instead, they remain in place until you delete or modify them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pages are usually used for evergreen content like contact details pages, an <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/about-us-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">About Us page design<\/a>, and even a new <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/landing-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">landing page design<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34922\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square.jpg 500w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-48x48.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Generally speaking, the pages section of WordPress holds the key landing pages of a website.

Whoever creates a page is considered its official owner until someone else takes ownership via an administrative action (such as transferring ownership rights).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">WordPress Posts Vs.
