Think about it as a comprehensive, strategic <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website development process<\/a> that takes its time to get it right, and get you the online presence you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, this is our (relatively) simple 8-step ultimate web design process, from the initial planning phases through production and completion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\u2019t worry: our clients play a key role in each stage of the journey!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-quick-client-web-design-process-overview\">A Quick Client Web Design Process Overview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s involved in each design phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pre-kickoff<\/strong>. We\u2019re just getting the web design project started. We\u2019ll get to know each other, and begin research on your target market. Through your web design RFP, client surveys, and other documents, we\u2019ll also learn more about your brand, business, and technical requirements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kickoff<\/strong>. The kickoff, either virtual or in-person, is the official start of the project when we\u2019ll define all elements of the project scope to nail it down and avoid any scope creep later on. We\u2019ll work together in a workshop format to define success, work on goal identification, and start thinking through structure and design and development direction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Discovery Phase<\/strong>. This is a critical step of web design. We\u2019re digging deeper, combining your notes from the kickoff with our own research and analytics. We build elements like personas, sitemap and wireframe, and other visual design documents. We\u2019ll also set up weekly status meetings with you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creative<\/strong>. At this initial stage of setting the design for your website, we make sure we\u2019re on the same page creatively through mood boards and concept designs. We then take those findings to build out prototypes. In this phase of the web design process we also design the website&#8217;s real-life interface.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Development<\/strong>. Time to start coding and actually build the website! In the development phase of the website project, you can expect work on the front-end, back-end, and content management systems. Regular check-ins and early access to a staging server allow us to stay in sync with our clients.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pre-Launch<\/strong>. We\u2019re getting ready for the big day. That means extended testing of all features, bug fixes, fixing broken links, and other tweaks to make sure it\u2019s just right. We\u2019ll also schedule the launch and handover date with you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Launch<\/strong>. On the day of the launch, our website design and development project team is available to work on any last-minute fixes and adjustments. By the end of the day, you have a fully functioning, beautiful new website.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Post-Launch<\/strong>. We\u2019ll work for at least 10 business days with each client to fix additional bugs, broken links, and make routine tweaks. We\u2019ll also chat with you on potential long-term engagements for ongoing support.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Let\u2019s dive into a little more detail for each stage of the website design process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter1\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 1<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Pre-Kickoff Stage<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Let&#8217;s get to know each other. In this step, we&#8217;ll focus on two things: information gathering and scheduling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">That means building on the information in your RFP to flesh out the scope of the project further. All clients fill out a brand and onboarding survey and participate in stakeholder interviews. Behavior tracking software helps us better understand your audience and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optimize for conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pre-Kickoff-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Meanwhile, we&#8217;ll set up a schedule for the project and meetings. This is the time to set up project management tools that will guide the client and project team through the entire process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Any initial questions? We&#8217;ll answer them here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-pre-kickoff-stage\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Pre-Kickoff Stage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You get you to know who you\u2019re working with. You also get an idea of exactly how you\u2019ll interact with your web design agency partner throughout the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes both a detailed project timeline and basic training on the project management tools used throughout the process. By the end of this step, the stage has been set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 2<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Kickoff Meeting<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The kickoff meeting is a comprehensive workshop. It&#8217;s the best way to learn about everything behind your need for a new website.&nbsp;We focus on questions like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What challenges does your business face?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What are the pain points that led you to a new website design?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What, in your eyes, would make a website successful?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Who is your target audience?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Depending on circumstances and location, the kickoff meeting can be conducted virtually or in-person. Either way, it&#8217;s a workshop format, collaborative in nature, that all key stakeholders from the agency and client-side join.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Kickoff meetings work best when every decision-maker on the client-side is included. That might end with your CMO or go as far up as the owner. The more brainpower, the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">We bring the agenda. You bring insights. That includes exercises to truly understand your brand, establish measurable goals, think through the structure of the new site, and hone in on the creative direction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">By the end of the workshop, the project is officially kicked off. We have what we need to start planning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-kickoff-meeting\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Kickoff Meeting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time the workshop is over, you truly know who you\u2019re working with. The creative brief will give you a fresh perspective on your business, and how your website might help you grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s just the start. All clients will receive a concise list of goals the website needs to accomplish from start to finish, alongside a document with key takeaways on site structure and creative direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, by the time we wrap up the meeting, you\u2019ll be able to see the first design elements of your new website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 3<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Discovery and Planning Phase<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to expand on that kickoff meeting. A comprehensive analysis compares its findings with quantitative data and analytics. Our goal is to find both points of convergence and divergence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of those points, you can expect our proposed design process steps. That means a comprehensive sitemap of the website\u2019s structure. We\u2019ll also create other supporting documents like wireframes, along with user flow charts, Gannt charts, and personas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Discovery-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">At this point, the weekly meetings are going strong. We\u2019ll also establish a regular flow of collaboration in our <a href=\"https:\/\/clientvenue.com\/blog\/advertising-agency-project-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">project management software<\/a> to keep the productivity going and keep you in the loop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-discovery-and-planning-phase\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Discovery and Planning Phase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll keep you in the loop. Ultimately, you get a comprehensive plan describing your new website\u2019s strategic direction. That starts with a summary of our findings and rationale, but also includes a more intuitive and logical site structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User personas and key user flows matter for our process but can be valuable for other marketing efforts as well. Finally, at the end of this planning phase we\u2019ll deliver and discuss creative mood boards to give you an idea of the creative direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 4<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Creative &amp; Design Phase<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">So far, it&#8217;s been all about the strategy. In step 4, we begin to boil that strategy down into actual, visible, appealing creative and concepts during the design process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wireframes\">Wireframes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35616\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Wireframes-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The mood boards in the previous step kick off that project, your feedback included. Now, it\u2019s full steam ahead on exploring the creative direction. To get there, we\u2019ll deliver high-fi designs and content elements, prototypes that allow you to visualize your new site. We\u2019ll make sure to have the color scheme, brand fonts, and other brand elements dialed in with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on your feedback, discussed in the now-standard weekly meetings, we\u2019ll collaborate on more polished user interfaces and potential animations. We\u2019ll also source all visual assets like images and video, to make sure we have what we need to produce the creative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-copy-content\">Copy &amp; Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Copy and content creation are executed in parallel with the high-fi designs. We develop Google content doc templates mirroring the structure of the wireframes that both teams can collaborate with. Here we\u2019ll help refine the voice and intent of the already existing website content, so it sounds as great as it looks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-preparing-for-development\">Preparing For Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Style-Guides-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The design process ends with a formal hand-off to the web development team, but only once everyone involved is 100% behind it. In this hand-off, we\u2019ll produce visual style guides and technical specification documents to ensure the website design is consistent and matches up with the functionality requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-creative-design-phase\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Creative \/ Design Phase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than beginning to see your brand identity in flesh and blood? You get multiple concepts that help you identify your preferred direction.

But we\u2019ll also deliver all native design styles.

Instead, we\u2019ll guide you through it in our development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorbanuses a section-based development, which means we don\u2019t keep you in the dark until the site is ready. Instead, you\u2019re involved throughout the web design process. All we need is your continued collaboration and participating in our software and weekly meetings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development process starts with setting up the dev, test, and live environments of the site. It also includes setting up the framework and content management system. We\u2019ll map out content management needs, work on software integrations, and, of course, the actual coding on the front and back end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end of the base set up brings with it SEO strategy, data migration and analytics set up. It also includes testing for performance, load, and any other functions. And of course, we\u2019ll run regular backups to preserve your site. We want you to have a well-oiled website, after all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-web-development-phase\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Web Development Phase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a functional, coded site on the development server? Yes, it doesn\u2019t actually end there.

You know your site will be ready for the final push.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of this step. It\u2019s our chance to write and double-check all page titles and meta descriptions. We\u2019ll clean up 301 redirects, and block confirmation pages from being indexed. Compressed images, Javascript, and CSS ensure fast and efficient load times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not done yet. Through lazy loading and caching mechanisms, we\u2019ll further speed up the site. All analytics and goals tracking and optimizations will be ready, and we\u2019ll also make sure search engines like Google like your site for search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final piece is a comprehensive quality assurance from both the development and the client team.

By the end of this step, you\u2019ll know exactly when your beautiful, functional, new website finally sees the light of day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Want Our Checklist?<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">This article covers our entire <a href=\"\/blog\/website-launch-checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website launch checklist<\/a> \u2013 enjoy!<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter7\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 7<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Website Launch<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the day of the launch. A stressful, exciting time. Dial-up the exciting and tone down the stressful if you\u2019ve gone through all the above steps, but you still want to get this day right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, that means all critical members of the project team will be available the entire day. That way, we can quickly squelch any problems that might surface. To catch them, we go over a comprehensive final launch checklist with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll make sure that the SSL is working and your site is secure. We\u2019ll also switch over your DNS, the domain name that your users will use, to point to the live website. Any issues there? We\u2019ll resolve them on the spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, we verify the successful launch with you at the end of the day. That way, everything is clear and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-your-website-launch\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of Your Website Launch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">A shiny, new website of course! Even better, you\u2019ll get a website that you know will function well, is secure, and free of bugs. Congratulations\u2014you\u2019ve made it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter8\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Step 8<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Post-Launch Phase<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website is done, but our web design workflow is not over. Not quite, at least. If this is a comprehensive website redesign, you might see your search results dip temporarily. We\u2019ll prepare you and walk you through the reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not it, though. After launching the website, all of our clients receive limited ongoing support for 10 business days .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that time, we\u2019ll monitor your website speed, conversions, and form conversions. If any issues pop up, we\u2019ll resolve them.<br>Beyond bug fixes, we will also start talking to you about a longer engagement. That might include ongoing QA or feature requests that were beyond the scope of the initial launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also offer ongoing search engine optimization services that will improve your site\u2019s (and business) visibility and brand awareness over time. Expect a conversation about how we can help you build SEO-focused content strategies and tactics to accomplish those goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll hear from us about our Grow agreement, an ongoing engagement that keeps us working together to improve your website\u2019s conversion rate over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-you-ll-get-out-of-the-post-launch-phase\">What You&#8217;ll Get Out of the Post-Launch Phase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, you\u2019ll be able to rest easy knowing that your investment is safe, and the launch went well. The initial post-launch support helps you clean up anything you need to get rolling on the new site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other piece you\u2019ll get is the option for <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-support\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ongoing website support<\/a>. We won\u2019t pressure you on that. But we will walk you through your options to make sure you have what you need to run (and improve!) your website over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s it! By the end of this step, you\u2019ll have a website in-hand that\u2019s as beautiful and on-brand as it\u2019s functional. Any questions about our web design process?

We try to answer them here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-web-designing-process\">What is the web designing process?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The web designing process is the set of steps that web designers follow to create websites. The process can be divided into four broad stages: planning, design, development, and testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the planning stage, web designers gather information about the client&#8217;s business, their target audience, and the purpose of the website. They also research similar websites to get ideas for the design. Once they have a good understanding of the project, they create a sitemap, which is a map of all the pages on the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the design stage, web designers create mockups of how the website will look. These mockups are then turned into web pages using HTML and CSS. Web designers also need to consider how the website will be used on different devices, such as smartphones and tablets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the development stage, web developers take the web pages created by web designers and turn them into functioning websites. They add interactivity using programming languages such as JavaScript and PHP. Web developers also need to make sure that the website is secure and can handle any traffic that it receives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in the testing stage, web designers test the website to make sure that it works as expected. They check for any errors and test how well the website works on different browsers and devices. Once everything is working properly, the website is launched for everyone to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-help-develop-web-apps\">Do you help develop web apps?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not an app development company per se, but depending on your needs, a web application could potentially be included as part of the scope definition. Feel free to talk to us about your web project, and we\u2019ll decide if we can serve you or if we prefer to refer you to one of our software development partners that specializes in web applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-5-steps-of-the-web-design-process\">What are the 5 steps of the web design process?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some designers break the web design process into five steps. These five steps of the web design process are: design, review, develop, test, and launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The design step is when the web designer creates a mockup of the website, using a wireframe or Photoshop. This is where the website&#8217;s layout, colors, and other visual elements are decided.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The review step is when the web designer shows the mockup to the client and gets feedback. The client may want changes to be made to the design.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The development step is when the web designer codes the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The test step is when the web designer tests the website on different browsers and devices to make sure it looks and works correctly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The launch step is when the web designer uploads the website to a web hosting company and makes it live for everyone to see.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-provide-ongoing-website-maintenance\">Do you provide ongoing website maintenance?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, in addition to designing websites, we provide ongoing website maintenance and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-support\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website support<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-7-steps-in-the-design-process\">What are the 7 steps in the design process?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some web designers break the web design process into 7 crucial steps: defining the problem, conducting research, brainstorming and conceptualizing, creating a prototype, selecting and finalizing, product analysis, and improving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first step, defining the problem, is important because it helps designers understand what they need to design. They need to identify the needs of their users and what they want to design before they can begin.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conducting research is the second step. This helps designers learn about their users and their needs. They also need to understand what similar products are available and how they work. This information helps them generate ideas for their design.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The third step is brainstorming and conceptualizing. In this step, designers generate ideas for their design. They think about how their design will solve the problem they identified in the first step. They also consider what features their design should have and how it will be used by users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The fourth step is creating a prototype. A prototype is a mock-up of the design that allows designers to test how it works in real life. This helps them identify any problems with their design and make necessary changes before finalizing it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The fifth step is selecting and finalizing. In this step, designers choose the best idea from their brainstorming and make it into a real design. They also add any finishing touches to their design, such as colors and graphics.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The sixth step is product analysis. In this step, designers test their product with users to see how well it works. They gather feedback from users to see if there are any problems with the product. based on this feedback, they may make changes to their design.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The seventh and final step is improving. In this step, designers take what they learned in the previous steps and use it to improve their design. They make changes to their design based on user feedback and testing results. This ensures that their design is the best it can be before it goes to market.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-further-reading-on-website-design-and-development\">Further Reading On Website Design and Development.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web development<\/a> and design inspiration?
