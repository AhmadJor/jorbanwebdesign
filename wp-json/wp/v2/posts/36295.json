Print ads and billboards may still be around, but they aren\u2019t as effective as they used to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the rise of the internet, new marketing methods have emerged. New electronic devices have made using the internet even quicker and easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2013\/12\/04\/89-browse-or-buy-using-smartphones-and-tablets-during-their-commute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">statistics<\/a>, 89% of consumers browse or shop on their phones while on the go. They don\u2019t care about print ads as they\u2019re engaged on their phones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you need to take advantage of these new and effective ways to reach your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Digital Marketing Methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital marketing methods are here to stay and aren\u2019t going anywhere soon. They\u2019re an integral part of any online strategy business and are becoming more critical as time goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As social media algorithms change and new platforms are released, digital marketing is crucial to any business\u2019s survival. It means you have to keep up to stay ahead of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One perfect example that you can leverage as a B2B or B2C company is email marketing. You can use it to send out newsletters or announcements about new products or offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s vital for a business relationship where there might be some professional distance between both parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Growth and Rise of Digital Marketing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Growth-and-Rise-of-Digital-Marketing-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Growth and Rise of Digital Marketing\" class=\"wp-image-33570\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The growth and rise of digital marketing have been incredible, and they will only get better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 alone, digital marketing spending was forecasted to reach $102 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that number is expected to grow even further in the next five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, a company without an effective website is foolhardy to achieve success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no better way to reach customers than through your website. It serves as your physical store to display your products and boost your presence on the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That online presence has become the new storefront for B2B and B2C companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Long-Term and Short-Term Strategies of Digital Marketing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways a company can stay-up-date. These are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-term<\/strong>: In digital marketing, long-term strategies are far more effective but take longer to pay off. Usually, you need 6+ months before you start seeing consistent results. However, these strategies are geared toward your company\u2019s longevity and continued growth. A perfect example of this would be creating helpful content that speaks to your audience and position you as a thought leader.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Short-term<\/strong>: This strategy can still deliver a positive ROI, but you won\u2019t see the same high ROI as the long-term strategy. The benefit is that you start seeing the return much sooner. They are called short-term because they only go with the trend, which won\u2019t last long. For example, going with trends on social media like TikTok to market your products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">6 Examples of Marketing Strategies for Any Website<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build Your Brand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A web design system is a framework you can use to create your website and ensure it fits your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good web design allows you to build your site without reinventing the wheel every time you change.
