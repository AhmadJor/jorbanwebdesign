Maybe it\u2019s time to get rid of them or update them to serve your website\u2019s current needs. For example, you can upgrade your blogs to enhance your SEO.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Webpages<\/strong>: Go through all of the web pages on your site and delete any pages that are not being used anymore. If a page doesn\u2019t need to be listed on the home page, then there is no reason for it to be there.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Look Into UX<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For most websites, the best user experience wins. If your website has poor performance, your visitors may leave immediately before they get information that could benefit them and turn into sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good user experience makes it easy for your visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for on your website \u2014 without having to spend too much time searching around for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps improve your brand image, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, and boost sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UX design is a crucial part of the user experience. An excellent UX design ensures that the user experience is superb and that they can successfully navigate through your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an excellent UX design for your website, it will also help improve engagement rates and reduce bounce rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, wasting time on bad design is a mistake no one wants to make. According to a report, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/what-users-want-most-from-mobile-sites-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">52% of consumers<\/a> don\u2019t go back to a poorly designed website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-lifespan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">average lifespan of a website<\/a> is only 2.4 years \u2014 or less.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be time for you to think about your overall website design and consider a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-redesign-project-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">redesign project plan<\/a> with the help of professional UX designers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our help, you can ensure that your site is more accessible, intuitive, and easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pull motivation from these <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/user-experience-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">statistics<\/a> \u2014 a good UI can boost your website\u2019s conversion rate by 200% while the best UX design can increase conversions by up to 400%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Wrap Up<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenance is the key to having a good website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything works smoothly because your website is well maintained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t ignore the importance of your website\u2019s functionality because visitor interactions translate into leads, orders, and constant cash flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about WordPress website maintenance or get help with your website, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contact<\/a> the experts at Jorban.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer a wide range of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/wordpress-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">services for WP websites<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We came up with a list of the best practices for maintenance of your WordPress website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":42472,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":""},"categories":[33,35],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v20.9 (Yoast SEO v20.13) -
