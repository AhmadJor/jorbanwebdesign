It\u2019s also open source, which offers users the ability to make unlimited customizations as they see fit for their websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it was designed for people who use WordPress, you\u2019ll get support from the open-source community who have the experience you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before it became known as WooCommerce, the plugin actually had roots in a company called WooThemes, a premium theme company for WordPress founded by Adii Pienaar, Magnus Jepson, and Mark Forrester.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Mike Jolley and James Koster \u2014 two developers \u2014 would join the team to build WooCommerce, which was called Jigoshop in its infancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first version was launched in 2011, becoming an instant hit. In just two years, it achieved one million downloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2014, WooCommerce reached four million downloads. Because of its rapid growth, WooCommerce was acquired in 2015 by Automattic, a global distributed company noted for its contributions to WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same year, the plugin would be downloaded over seven million times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it powers over 22% of the best websites on WooCommerce as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.websitebuilderinsider.com\/is-woocommerce-made-by-wordpress\/#:~:text=Over%204%20million%20businesses%20use,is%20a%20plugin%20for%20WordPress.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">28%<\/a> of all the eCommerce stores that exist online.
