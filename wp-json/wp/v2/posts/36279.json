They are an important continuation of your marketing initiatives and act as a roadmap for your target market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ecommerce sales funnel is developed to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-establish-lead-generation-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">generate qualified leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each stage of the funnel is designed to lead qualified prospective customers to the next stages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potential customers start at the top of the sales funnel and work their way down, one step at a time until they become loyal customers of your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ecommerce Conversion Funnel Benchmarks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that ecommerce conversion rates can vary widely from one store to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some general benchmarks that can give you an idea of how your store stacks up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, ecommerce stores see a conversion rate of 2-3%. That means that for every 100 visitors to your store, only 2-3 of them will actually make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some ecommerce stores that see much higher conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, high-end fashion stores may see conversion rates as high as 10-15%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing to keep in mind is that your ecommerce conversion rate will depend on a number of factors, including the type of products you sell, your pricing, and your target market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no magic number that all ecommerce stores should aim for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the ecommerce conversion funnel can vary from business to business, there are some general benchmarks that can be used to measure success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a good ecommerce conversion funnel will typically have a high rate of website visitors who make it all the way to the decision stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a successful ecommerce business will usually have a low rate of customer churn, meaning that once a customer makes a purchase, they are likely to continue doing business with the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding and tracking these ecommerce conversion funnel benchmarks, businesses can ensure that they are on track to success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do Ecommerce Sales Funnels Work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily.jpg\" alt=\"First Level\" class=\"wp-image-35267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-can-your-customers-find-you-easily-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">First Level<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce sales funnels work by taking into account the customer and their buyer&#8217;s journey, which is the progression of steps a potential customer takes to go from one stage of the sales funnel to the next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are important things to consider while planning a buyer&#8217;s journey:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is your target audience and what information do they require from you?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering these questions will greatly assist you in deciding what material you should provide to meet all of your customers&#8217; needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the needs of your target audience, you can personalize your content to perfectly meet all their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you have a B2B and B2C company that sells a product to customers as well as is looking to gain investors then your content will need to talk about your product to potential customers as well as answer the question of why should I invest in your business to potential investors.

In order for customers to reach this stage, you need to invest in marketing and advertising.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interest<\/strong>: once the customer is aware of your product, they need to develop an interest in it. This can be achieved by providing more information about the product, such as specifications, reviews, and testimonials.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evaluation<\/strong>: at this stage, the customer evaluates whether your product meets their needs and whether it is worth the price. You can help customers make this decision by providing free trials or samples.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Purchase<\/strong>: finally, the customer decides to buy your product. To streamline this process, you should provide multiple payment options and make sure the checkout process is smooth and user-friendly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these steps, you can create a well-designed conversion funnel that will lead potential customers smoothly from awareness to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author.jpg 200w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-48x48.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Interviewing your customer service team can be a great exercise when building out your funnel to learn what&#8217;s important to prospective and existing customers.

This is typically done through awareness-building efforts like paid advertising or PR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal at this stage is to get potential customers interested in your products or services. &#8220;You can implement <a href=\"https:\/\/getvoip.com\/blog\/what-is-ccaas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contact center as a service<\/a>, social media, and other tools to improve customer communication.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-funnel is the stage where customers start to learn more about your ecommerce business and what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is typically done through education-focused pieces of content like blog posts or helpful guides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal at this stage is to get potential customers interested in your ecommerce business and what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower funnel\u2014called bottom of the funnel (BOFU)\u2014is the stage where customers are ready to make a purchase. This is typically done through targeted marketing campaigns or special offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal at this stage is to convert potential customers into paying customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding the ecommerce funnel, you can better map your sales and marketing efforts to optimize your conversion funnel and meet your customer&#8217;s needs at each stage of the funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I build an ecommerce sales funnel?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce brands can use a variety of marketing tactics to boost conversions and generate sales, but one of the most effective strategies is known as a &#8220;sales funnel.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sales funnel is a series of steps that ecommerce marketers use to lead potential customers from awareness of your product or service to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding the basic steps of how to build an ecommerce funnel, you can create a custom funnel that meets the specific needs of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in building an ecommerce funnel is to identify your target audience. Who are you trying to reach with your product or service?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know who your target audience is, you can begin to create content that resonates with them. This can be done through blog posts, social media content, or even ecommerce emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have created content that speaks to your target audience, the next step is to drive traffic to that content. This can be done through SEO, social media advertising, or even ecommerce retargeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have traffic coming to your content, it&#8217;s time to start converting that traffic into sales. This is where ecommerce landing pages and ecommerce checkout pages come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By creating ecommerce pages that are optimized for conversion, you can start turning your traffic into paying customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Further Reading On Web Design and Web Development<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in learning more about ecommerce sales conversion rate optimization, or just about web design, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web development<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web redesign<\/a> in general?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some handy resources to get you up to speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/shopify-audit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How We Conduct a Shopify Audit<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/top-retail-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Our Top Retail Website Examples<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/top-beauty-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Our Top Beauty Website Examples<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/shopify-speed-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Importance of Shopify Speed Optimization<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/resource\/shopify-speed-guide-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Our Shopify Speed Guide Checklist<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/100-ecommerce-web-design-tips-to-skyrocket-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">100 Ecommerce Website Design Tips<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-improve-mobile-ecommerce-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Improve Mobile Ecommerce Conversions<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/great-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Top 24 Website Design Inspirations for 2022<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/key-ui-ux-terms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Common UI\/UX Terms Used by Web Designers<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-launch-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your Must-Do Checklist For Launching a Website<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simple Ways Improve To Your Website<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/web-design-vs-web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Design and Web Development: Understanding the Difference<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/service-page-design-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Best Service Page Design Examples<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/startup-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Our Approach to Startup Web Design and Development<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/about-us-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Design an Effective \u201cAbout Us\u201d Page<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-footer-design-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website Footer Design Best Practices<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/product-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Designing the Best Product Pages<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/category-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Understanding Category Page Design<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To get more traffic and conversions, you need to optimize your website\u2019s ecommerce conversion funnel.
