The first step to getting more information out of an email address is setting up email automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using email automation to follow up on form submissions, you immediately accomplish two things: you ensure that the email address they submitted is valid and you begin the sales process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial component of the latter objective is sending a personalized email instead of a dry general email. This immediately starts building trust and starts increasing conversions. You can even use it to ask 3-5 additional questions you may need to know to qualify the prospect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of an e-mail we automatically send after someone fills out a form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><em>Hi First_Name,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To make sure we understand what you&#8217;re looking for, please share some information about your project:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Are you looking for a single project or ongoing work?

Applying contact form best practices to a form that requires more than 10 entries requires the use of multi-step forms with multiple fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being told that you only truly need a name and an email address on the contact form, you might be confused as to why you would ever need a form long enough that it requires multiple steps. The reasoning is simple \u2014 it depends heavily on the purpose of your contact form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that you\u2019re shopping around for an estimate on the value of your house. You see a real estate agency that promises a free online estimate, but the only thing their form asks is a name and an email address. What insight could they possibly offer you with only that information?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple contact forms are amazing solutions for longer forms, such as an application or registration form. They\u2019re also a good way to get more information from your leads \u2014 starting with \u201clow-friction\u201d or \u201clow-threat\u201d (e.g. what service are you looking for?) fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can engage them and allow you to ask more sensitive questions near the end when it\u2019s less likely for them to back out because they\u2019ve already invested time and effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-step forms that include a progress bar are also effective at getting users to complete forms, due to the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/10.1086\/500480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">endowed progress effect<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When making a multi-step form, the same conversion tips apply. You should keep each batch of fields short so you don\u2019t overwhelm the user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A case study from <a href=\"http:\/\/ventureharbour.com\/multi-step-lead-forms-get-300-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Venture Harbour<\/a> saw a 53% increase in conversion rate when they formatted 30+ questions in a four-step form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.formstack.com\/resources\/report-form-conversion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Formstack<\/a> backs this up \u2014 multi-step forms have a completion rate of 13.85%, compared to 4.53% on a single long form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Why &amp; When To Use Embedded Forms<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses keep separate <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/service-page-design-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">service pages<\/a> and contact form pages. However, forms that are directly embedded in landing pages tend to outperform CTAs to open a separate contact form page. The reasoning is, as always, convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you can, you should try and incorporate a simple contact form directly on key landing pages, ideally above the fold of the page and again at the bottom of the landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also stand out from the rest of the web page elements so your user can find it easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re following the previously highlighted conversion tips (i.e. keeping forms concise), then this should be relatively easy to accomplish from a design perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER six<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How To Keep Forms Secure (Without Hurting Conversions)<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart or CAPTCHAs are a great way to reduce spam and ensure you\u2019re getting quality information from your form, but did you know that visible CAPTCHAs actually hurt <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversion rates<\/a>?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35419\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633-48x30.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this case study from<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Moz<\/a>, having CAPTCHA on reduced the amount of spam conversions by 4.1% but companies could actually lose out on 3.2% of genuine conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely because CAPTCHA has become too difficult and confusing, in an effort to combat the increasing sophistication of spambots. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It simply isn\u2019t user-friendly \u2014 who wants to take the time to puzzle over a distorted set of letters or numbers and painstakingly type them out?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of using CAPTCHA, you can look to alternatives that are convenient or invisible to the front-end user but still keep spam and brute force attacks at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such example is Google\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/12\/3\/7325925\/google-is-killing-captcha-as-we-know-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> reCAPTCHA<\/a>, which can be as simple as clicking a checkbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter7\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER seven<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Tracking Performance &amp;

We try to answer them here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-website-contact-form\">What is a website contact form?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A contact form is a web-based form that allows visitors to your website to send you a message. It&#8217;s an easy way for people to get in touch with you without having to give out your email address or phone number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact forms can be used for a variety of purposes, such as requesting more information about your product or service, registering for an event, or even just asking a question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating a contact form on your website, you&#8217;ll need to decide what information you want to collect from your visitors. The most common fields include name, email address, and message. You can also add custom fields to collect additional information, such as phone number or company name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created your form, you&#8217;ll need to add it to your website. This can be done by adding a link to the form on your site&#8217;s navigation menu or by embedding the form directly into your website&#8217;s HTML code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-i-create-a-contact-form-for-my-website\">How do I create a contact form for my website?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A contact form is a great way to give your website visitors the opportunity to get in touch with you. There are a variety of ways to create a simple contact form, but the most important thing is to make sure that it is easy to use and that it captures the information you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, you will need to choose a method for collecting information from your website visitors. You can use a simple online form builder, or you can code the form yourself using HTML.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have chosen a method, you will need to decide what contact details you want to include in the form. The most basic contact forms will ask for a name and an email address, but you may also want to include space for a message or additional questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have decided on the information you want to include, you can start building your form. If you are using an online form builder, this process will be relatively simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you are coding the form yourself, you will need to have some knowledge of HTML. If you&#8217;re not comfortable dealing with code, there are also a number of WordPress plugin contact forms that you can easily add to your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your form is complete, be sure to test it out to make sure that it is working correctly. You can also add additional features, such as CAPTCHA, to help prevent spam submissions. Then, add the form to your website and wait for visitors to get in touch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/shopify-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify store<\/a>, a Webflow website, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce website<\/a>, a Drupal site, or are on some other platform, these tips apply equally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-types-of-forms-on-websites\">What are the types of forms on websites?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different types of forms that businesses use to collect information from customers, employees, and other stakeholders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact us forms, feedback forms, event forms, live chat, satisfaction surveys, marketing surveys, and job application forms are all common examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each type of form serves a different purpose, but all of them can be used to collect valuable data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A contact us form is a type of feedback form that helps businesses to stay in touch with their customers. It typically includes fields for name, email address, and comments or questions. Customers can use online contact forms to request more information about a product or service, make suggestions, or ask for help with a problem. Businesses can use a contact us form template that can provide a starting point for the contact form design which can be customized to fit the needs of the business.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An application form is a type of online contact form that is used to gather information from applicants. It usually includes fields for personal information, educational background, work history, and references. This type of online form helps businesses to screen candidates and select the best qualified individuals for open positions. Management software can be used to help with this process. This type of software can automate the gathering and sorting of data from application forms. It can also help businesses to keep track of applicants and compare them side-by-side. As a result, using an application form and management software can help businesses to streamline the hiring process and make it more efficient.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A registration form is an essential tool for businesses that want to collect information from individuals who want to register for an event or sign up for a newsletter. A registration form typically includes fields for name, email address, and mailing address. This information helps businesses keep track of their customers and ensure that they receive the latest information about upcoming events. There are a variety of registration form templates available online, and businesses can easily customize these forms to fit their specific needs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Event forms help businesses to keep track of event attendees and collect information about their preferences. By collecting contacts\u2019 names, email addresses, and phone numbers, businesses can easily follow up with attendees after the event.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Live chat provides a conversational form of communication that is well-suited for the digital age. By using a live chat tool, businesses can upload a form on their website that allows customers to ask questions and get answers in real time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Satisfaction surveys are an important tool for businesses to track customer satisfaction levels over time. By monitoring customer engagement, businesses can identify issues early on and make changes to improve the customer experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing surveys help businesses to understand customer needs and preferences. These surveys can help content marketers understand how customers consume content and how they make decisions about what to buy. By understanding these things, content marketers can create more effective content marketing strategies that deliver better results. Affiliate marketers can use surveys to track the results of their marketing campaigns. By understanding what works and what doesn&#8217;t, they can adjust their marketing strategy accordingly and continue to improve the reach and effectiveness of their marketing. Marketing software platforms like SurveyMonkey offers easy-to-use tools for creating marketing surveys.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Booking forms help people to schedule appointments or services. Oftentimes, these need to be filled out in advance in order to secure a spot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Request forms help people to request services or information. This might be something as simple as requesting a quote for a service or more information about a product.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evaluation forms help people to evaluate their satisfaction with a service or product. This is important feedback that can help businesses to improve their offerings. Google Sheets is a powerful tool that can help businesses to collect and track customer feedback.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign up forms help people to sign up for things like newsletters, email lists, or membership programs.This is a way to ensure that people are getting the information they want and need. With options such as WordPress plugin contact forms or Shopify apps, you can easily add a signup form to your website without any coding required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Collecting data through these various types of business forms is an essential part of running a successful business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-i-create-a-working-contact-form-in-html\">How do I create a working contact form in HTML?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A contact form is a great way to give your website visitors the ability to get in touch with you without having to share your personal contact information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, creating a contact form can be a bit tricky if you&#8217;re not familiar with HTML. The good news is that there are plenty of application form templates, tutorials and examples online that can help you get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a contact form, you&#8217;ll need to use the &#8221; tag, which defines a form element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the &#8221; tag, you&#8217;ll need to include various &#8221; tags that will allow the user to enter their name, email address, and message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have all of the necessary input fields, you&#8217;ll need to add a &#8221; that will submit the form data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll need to add a bit of code to process the form data and send it to your email address. With a little bit of effort, you can easily create a working contact form for your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-there-free-html-contact-form-code\">Is there free HTML contact form code?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways to create a contact form using HTML. One approach is to use a pre-made contact form template. Many websites offer free HTML contact form code that you can copy and paste into your own website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just a few clicks, you can add a responsive contact form to your site. And if you want to get more creative, there are also dozens of code snippets that offer more advanced features, such as file uploads and dropdown menus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to use a drag and drop online form builder tool. These tools usually have a free trial or low-cost monthly subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-i-create-a-bootstrap-contact-form\">How do I create a bootstrap contact form?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to create a bootstrap contact form, you will need to use the Bootstrap framework and CSS. Bootstrap is a front-end web development framework that provides a number of helpful CSS classes for creating forms. Once you have imported the Bootstrap CSS file into your project, you can begin creating your form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you will need to create a element and add the appropriate attributes. Then, you will need to add a series of<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>elements with the class &#8220;form-group&#8221; in order to structure your form. Within each<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>element, you will need to add a element and an element. The element will contain the text for each field, and the element will contain the actual input field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you will need to add a submit button. Once you have added all of these elements, your form should be fully functional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-people-use-contact-forms-on-websites\">Do people use contact forms on websites?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many ways for website visitors to get in touch with a business or individual, contact forms remain one of the most popular options. There are a number of reasons for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>First, contact forms are easy to use. Visitors simply fill out the form and submit it, and their message is sent directly to the desired recipient.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secondly, contact forms help to ensure that messages are delivered correctly. With email, there is always a risk that messages will be sent to the wrong address or that they will be caught by spam filters. Contact forms help to avoid these problems by routing messages directly to the intended recipient.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finally, contact forms can help businesses to quickly gather information from customers or prospects. By including questions on the form, businesses can collect data that can be used to improve their products or services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For all these reasons, contact forms continue to be a popular way for people to get in touch with businesses and individuals online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-google-sites-have-a-contact-form\">Does Google Sites have a contact form?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Google Sites, you can add in a Google form to act as a contact form. The process is simple and only takes a few minutes to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, create a page on your site for the contact form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, add a &#8220;Contact Form&#8221; gadget to the page. This will provide you with a basic form that includes fields for the visitor&#8217;s name, email address, and message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then customize the form to include additional fields, such as phone number or company name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are finished, save the form and publish your site. The contact form will then be live and available for visitors to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-is-better-woocommerce-or-shopify\">Which is better, WooCommerce or Shopify?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing WooCommerce vs Shopify, there is no clear winner.
