Make a List (or Two)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Make-a-List-or-or-Two.jpg\" alt=\"Make a List or or Two\" class=\"wp-image-33583\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Making a list of your expectations and goals can narrow down your options, which is a huge help if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. Start out by making a list of what you want from an agency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself the following while you write this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of help do you need?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What kind of website do you need?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are you looking for someone to create a new <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website design<\/a> from scratch, or are you looking for someone to help you update an existing site with a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website redesign<\/a>?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What style do you want your website to be?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you need them to work in a specific content management system?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What size agency do you want to work with?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you want someone to add new features or fix bugs for an existing website, this will help you narrow your search to agencies that offer these services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want 24\/7 customer service, you\u2019ll want to look for an international agency; if you want to support local businesses, you\u2019ll want to shop smaller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no right or wrong answers here; it all depends on your preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re looking for, it might be worth chatting with a few different agencies and getting some quotes before making a decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve listed out your expectations, it\u2019s time to list out your goals for the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself the following while you write this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What do you want to get out of a new website?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How do you want it to look?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How do you want it to interact with any integrations you might already use?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By answering these questions, you\u2019ll be able to communicate much more easily when meeting with potential designers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019ll help them understand your vision and create a proposal and quote that properly addresses your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Get Searching<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve made your lists, it\u2019s time to search for an agency that fits your criteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things that we recommend doing when searching for them: Googling things yourself and checking out lists on third-party websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, do some Googling. SEO is essential for any web design and development company; after all, what\u2019s the point of having a beautifully designed website if no one can find it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to run a quick Google search before you hire anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can see where they rank in the search results and get an idea of their reputation. You might even be able to find their Google profile and read more reviews from previous customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you find a company you\u2019re interested in, add them to a list to come back to later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from reviews, however, it can be hard to trust everything on a company\u2019s website. This is where third-party websites come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve compiled a list of companies you\u2019re interested in, check out third-party websites to find previous work, more reviews and testimonials from clients, and other essential information that can help you determine if you want to reach out to the company or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checking these websites is a great way to get an unbiased opinion of the company, and it can also give you some insight into the quality of their work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you\u2019ll have to take everything you read with a grain of salt, it\u2019s still a valuable resource.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Deep Dive into Research<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, once you\u2019ve narrowed your hunt down to a short list of companies, it\u2019s time to dig deeper into them. The best way to start is by scrutinizing their experience and knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with their \u201cAbout\u201d page to find out how long they\u2019ve been in the business. If it isn\u2019t listed, you might be able to find this information via Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, you can look to their previous work again to see their style and look at their blog to see what insights they have to offer on the latest trends in web design and development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve dug up all of this information, you can compare your remaining options and scratch out the ones that don\u2019t have the experience or knowledge to provide what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What to Look for in a Web Design Agency<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re still struggling to make the final decision, breaking down what you need is critical so you won\u2019t get quickly reeled in by interesting features and services that you don\u2019t actually need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand that everyone\u2019s needs are different; however, there\u2019s still a simple way to decide whether a company will meet yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself these three questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>What can they do?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What results do they yield?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can they help you?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll walk you through the importance of each question below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. What Can They Do?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look back to your list of what you want from an agency; are you still considering any companies that don\u2019t offer those services? Double-check. If so, remove them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, think about how the work process will affect you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some agencies work entirely remotely, while others will require some in-person meetings. What are you looking for in this regard? Scratch off anyone that doesn\u2019t fit the bill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you need someone to work quickly? Check their reviews and their website to find comments on their turnaround times and see if they have any timeline guarantees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, consider how much input you want to have in the design process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some agencies allow their clients to be very involved, while others take a more hands-off approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. What Results Do They Yield?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/What-Results-Do-They-Yield-.jpg\" alt=\"What Results Do They Yield\" class=\"wp-image-33584\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to look for is results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick list of the things you\u2019ll want to see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of results do they get for their clients?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do they have any <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/case-studies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">case studies<\/a> that you can review?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What do those case studies say about the results they achieved?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for an agency with experience in your industry or field is also essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ll know what kind of design elements will resonate with your target audience and help you achieve your business goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to find an agency that can point you to a website in your field that they designed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. How Can They Help You?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, you\u2019ll want to ask them questions about their process and how they\u2019ve helped similar companies in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to make sure that their previous experience will translate well into meeting your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good web design agency can show you examples of their work that are similar to what you\u2019re looking for, take your project from start to finish without any major hiccups, and keep you up-to-date regarding their progress along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How Does JorbanStack Up?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Jorbanon your list of candidates?
