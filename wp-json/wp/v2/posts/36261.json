And when it comes to designing an effective careers page, there are two key elements to keep in mind: UX design and UI design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-career-page-ux-design\">Career Page UX Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a positive UX, start by making sure your careers page is easy to navigate and provides all the information a potential candidate might be looking for. Include clear calls to action, and make it easy for candidates to submit their resumes or applications. You should also design your careers page with mobile users in mind. According to recent studies, more than 60% of job seekers use their smartphones to search for open positions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-career-page-ui-design\">Career Page UI Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to UI design, the goal is to create a visually-appealing page that makes a good first impression. Use high-quality images and videos, and make sure the overall design is consistent with your company&#8217;s brand. Pay attention to the finer details, like typography and whitespace. Small tweaks in your UI design can make a big difference in how your careers page is received by potential candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a company\u2019s career page on your website could be the key to attract candidates that will help your brand flourish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you create an effective career page? We\u2019ve compiled some amazing tips and examples right here in this article. Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How To Make Awesome Career Listing Pages<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your career listing pages are the first thing that potential applicants will see when they\u2019re considering whether they want to work with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you need a career page design that is straightforward and complete, but interesting enough to make them want to read more about your individual job listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-demonstrate-who-you-are\"><strong>Demonstrate Who You Are<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your career page must describe who you are as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your referral program should be designed to attract the attention of employment seekers who are already familiar with your brand. Start by teaching them about your brand\u2019s core values with a brief description of how it came to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about when it started, how it was founded, the team behind your business, and who is currently working with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider your tone and language when writing blog posts and other content for your page to make sure that it matches the overarching voice you want your brand to be known for. Doing so will help ensure that referral program participants are more likely to be engaged with your brand and refer others who are a good fit for your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pipedrive@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipedrive.com\/en\/jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pipedrive<\/a> website above as an example of great <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/saas-and-technology-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SaaS website design<\/a>, especially in the career page department. The interface for their website and career page is neat, simple, and readily contains all of the information that prospective candidates need to know about the brand\u2019s core values and its history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employee engagement is a huge part of employer branding, and Pipedrive does a great job of sharing its team&#8217;s story on its website and career page. The included pictures of their team are a nice touch, as they help applicants become more familiar with the people behind the business. Locations are also clearly stated at the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BusinessofFashion@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good example is the website for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessoffashion.com\/organisations\/the-business-of-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Business of Fashion<\/a>. They get right down to business and open the website with a description of their organization. The design of the page is sleek and minimal, but it still showcases their biggest achievements and provides a detailed description of their brand\u2019s core values and what they\u2019re like as a company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also include a complete list of key people within their organization, which can help new hires get their bearings in the company faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-show-what-you-stand-for\"><strong>Show What You Stand For<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing your core values should also be the top priority in designing a career page. You want to find employees that are compatible with your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skills are a priority, but ultimately, if your employees don\u2019t agree with your brand\u2019s values and mission or vice versa, then the working relationship isn\u2019t built to last. Putting your company\u2019s core values on your page filters through applicants, leaving only the most suitable candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Slack@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example of showing what you stand for can be seen with <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/careers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack\u2019s<\/a> career page. From the moment you enter the page, you can see which core values the business revolves around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They use their graphics wisely, emphasizing their inclusivity with the headlining image at the top of the page. They also highlight this throughout the page, as seen in their values and other descriptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Etsy@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Slack, <a href=\"https:\/\/careers.etsy.com\/global\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Etsy\u2019s<\/a> career page also showcases its values through lovely images and nicely worded descriptions. The section dedicated to their mission and core values is one of the first and longest parts of the page, efficiently getting the message across even as employment seekers scroll past it. We love this example of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/ecommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eCommerce website design<\/a> applied to a careers page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-show-what-it-s-like-to-work-there\"><strong>Show What It\u2019s Like to Work There<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give your prospective candidate an idea of what it\u2019s like to work in your company. This helps them ease into the idea of being a part of your workplace and know what to expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going for a professional look is okay, but ultimately, adding some candid shots of your employees and workplace will make your company look more authentic and inviting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These pictures could include shots of your team during work at the office or in a meeting. You could also add some photos of events, like team-building trips or office parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Canva@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see this on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/careers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canva\u2019s<\/a> website. They\u2019ve got a whole section dedicated to pictures of their employees. They have also organized their job postings into categories and added pictures for each one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from demonstrating the job opportunities they have for applicants, they also show what it\u2019s like to work in that specific division of their company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namely is another good example. Their career page takes on an employee-centered approach, expressing that their employees are the heart of their business through a brief opening description. This is accompanied by some candid pictures of their employees. They\u2019re able to achieve an authentic look with fewer pictures than Canva has used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-social-proof\"><strong>Use Social Proof<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social proof is always an effective way of letting a prospective candidate know what life is like at your workplace. Ask your existing employees to give some feedback about their experience at your company. This could either be blogs or short videos, structured like a vlog or an interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to feature some employee-centered awards on the career page as well, such as best workplace awards, since they add to your credibility as an employer. You could also feature employee success stories as articles on your career page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also feature successful customer stories as articles on your career page. This would show prospective employees that you are not only concerned with making money, but also with making sure your customers are happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Hubspot@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective example of using social proof can be seen on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/careers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HubSpot\u2019s<\/a> career page. They have their employee-centered awards and ratings at the bottom of their page. Their employee testimonials are structured as a pop-up window that stays on the side of the page. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It flips through the testimonials like videos on a phone, which is a cool and unique touch. Once you click on the pop-up, you\u2019ll see short videos of employees from different divisions talking about their experience at HubSpot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">As a content marketer, I know the importance of social proof.

It is software that promotes maximum productivity and organization by sorting through job applications and publishing jobs. A recruitment software like ATS can save businesses time and money while streamlining the recruiting process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ATS can be fully accessed by all of your employees, making it easier to monitor and manage the application process. Having access to cutting-edge HR software can lessen the burden on your team. It requires less time and effort to manage, allowing you and your team to delegate tasks and focus on other requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-central-hub-for-job-posts\"><strong>A Central Hub for Job Posts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing your job posts can be difficult, given the large number of job boards available for employment seekers. Manually posting your openings on each one and managing the independent pools of applicants causes issues with organization and efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hiring platform allows you to post your job openings and manage interview scheduling from a single, centralized system. This makes it easy to keep track of who you&#8217;ve contacted and who still needs to be followed up with. It also allows you to quickly identify any patterns or commonalities among the candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of apps that can help to streamline the process of posting job openings and managing applicants. Web apps can allow you to post your openings to multiple job boards with just a few clicks, and they also provide a central location for tracking all of your applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidate sourcing is one of the most important aspects of recruiting .A recruitment management system can help you develop and optimize your recruitment strategy so you can target the right candidates more effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an ATS allows you to do all of this from one spot, saving time and allowing your team to focus on more important matters throughout the hiring process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-automation-and-efficiency\">Automation and Efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Automation is every company\u2019s saving grace when they\u2019re in the process of hiring new talents. First of all, it requires less manpower compared to manual tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of using an ATS is quick and seamless. You can save job listings, set up automated responses to applicants, and manage, organize, and notate the upgrades with a few simple clicks. An ATS can also help you track your recruitment marketing efforts and measure your ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">There are a lot of different applicant tracking software solutions out there to improve your careers page.

A career page should be more than just a list of open positions; it should be a comprehensive overview of what your company has to offer potential employees. Here are some tips for creating an effective career page:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, make sure that your career page is easy to find and navigate. Include clear links on your website&#8217;s homepage and other relevant pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, use compelling copy and imagery to sell potential employees on the benefits of working for your company. What makes your company culture unique? What kinds of opportunities are available for professional growth? Be sure to highlight these points in an engaging way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, include detailed information about each open position, including job descriptions, qualifications, and compensation packages. By taking the time to create a well-rounded and informative career page, you&#8217;ll be more likely to attract top talent to your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/hubspot-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HubSpot<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/wordpress-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce website<\/a>\u2014or are on a different platform entirely\u2014these tips apply equally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-career-options-in-design\">What are career options in design?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A career in design can encompass a wide range of activities, from crafting individual products to planning entire buildings or landscapes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers often specialize in a particular type of design, such as fashion, graphic, or interior design. Others may choose to focus on a specific industry, such as healthcare or hospitality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to traditional design jobs, there is also a growing demand for designers who are skilled in new technologies, such as user experience (UX) design and 3D printing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what their specialty, all designers share a creative vision and an eye for detail. If you are interested in pursuing a career in design, there are many options available to you. With hard work and dedication, you can find the perfect job to match your skills and interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-is-the-best-career-site\">Which is the best career site?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Career sites provide a wealth of information on a variety of topics, from exploring different career options to finding job openings in your area. They can also be a great way to learn about salary negotiation skills or get tips on writing a resume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing a career site, it is important to find one that offers the resources you need. For example, if you are looking for information on specific careers, you will want to find a site that offers detailed career profiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you are simply looking for job postings, a site that aggregates listings from multiple job boards may be more useful. Ultimately, the best career site is the one that meets your needs and helps you achieve your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-are-the-10-best-career-page-design-examples\">Which are the 10 best career page design examples?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will make in your life.
