If your budget is tight and you\u2019re somewhat tech-savvy, you can even design a simple WordPress website on your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for anything more complex than a single page, we suggest investing in professional development, whether you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/wordpress-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing a premium WordPress website<\/a> or want a complex <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/shopify-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify ecommerce site<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Does a Website Cost Per Month?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs of website maintenance can add up, especially if your website has a lot of pages or a complex design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to over $500 or more per month on site maintenance, depending on the freelancer or agency you\u2019re working with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Does a Website Cost Per Year?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, yearly costs of maintaining a website range from $400 to $60,000.

You can focus on manufacturing quality goods, streamlining your services, or hiring dependable manpower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most, a website is treated as an investment. This is something that customers directly interact with, so you want to put your best foot forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some important considerations before you spend money on a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Premium Website Is Not for Bootstrapped Start-ups and Very Small Businesses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re just beginning as a company, you might be tempted to get a premium <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/startup-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">startup website<\/a> to give off authoritative branding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a very small business might want a high-end site to provide better customer service to their loyal customers or improve their marketing. But hear us out\u2014investing in a premium website is not a good decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious reason for this is the high costs of building, launching, and maintaining a premium website. Premium themes with complicated functionalities (that your customers will probably not use) will add up to the expense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For very small businesses, the costs will not lead to high ROI. It will eat up your capital long before it starts to pay off\u2014if it ever does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start-ups must also focus on selling their products or services first before trying anything too flashy. It\u2019s more important to establish your capabilities as it helps create a stronger customer base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Premium Website Is for Established Businesses and Funded Start-ups<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is earning around $5 million in revenue annually, you can consider yourself an established company. This is the best moment to start investing in a premium professional website as it can help streamline your processes and add to your revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web design is particularly important for companies that use their website for services, such as those that sell enterprise software, expensive equipment, or goods directly to customers (which is why good <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/ecommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ecommerce store design<\/a> is integral).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs will be justified with the increased engagement with customers, easy tracking of data for reports, and automated integrations including useful premium plugins. Therefore, a premium website is definitely a worth-it investment that will result in high ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Buying a Website Is a Lot Like Buying a Home<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Buying-a-Website-Is-a-Lot-Like-Buying-a-Home@2x-1024x633-48x30.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want an easy analogy of website pricing, we can compare it to buying a home. There are a lot of correlations that can help you visualize the aspects of a website and variables affecting the pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a 2,000 sq ft home in San Francisco will cost more than the same size in Charleston. Similarly, a 5,000 sq ft home in the same will have a higher average cost than 1,500 sqft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same principle applies for a website, and here are more aspects to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Square Feet = Page Count<\/strong>: Much like how the square feet dictate the space available in a property, the page count limits the amount of content you can add to your website.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Features\/Layouts = Integrations\/Complexity<\/strong>: Pools, outdoor areas, and security additions in a house are equivalent to carts, analytics, and live chat features on a website.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finishes = Design and Assets<\/strong>: Hardwood floors? High-vaulted ceilings? These finishes can be compared to the visual design, navigation, and typography of your website.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Location = Company Size and Maturity<\/strong>: Properties in in-demand locations are more expensive. Same goes for an established business, which expects more traffic and conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER six<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What Are the Website Costs for Start-Ups and Very Small Businesses?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Website Price Range:<\/strong> $200 \u2013 $10,000 Per Year<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Startup@2x-1024x633-48x30.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, start-ups and very small businesses should only buy a website that isn\u2019t expensive.

If you\u2019re in industries like cooking, art, or retail, you probably have little to no idea about how a website works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have some technical knowledge or a background in marketing or design, a do-it-yourself website might be your best option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few established website builders out there like Wix and Squarespace, which offer tools that make it easy to design and develop a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can customize these yourself to create something that suits your company\u2019s branding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Anticipated Complexity: Low, 5 to 10 Pages<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most basic website will only have a single page where all its content is crammed. This is only applicable in certain circumstances, and you should generally avoid one-page websites as much as possible, as they\u2019re not great for scrolling and overall user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best starting number of pages should be at least five, which gives you space for some <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/best-content-for-a-homepage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">homepage content<\/a>, a page to list your products\/services, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/about-us-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">well-designed about us page<\/a>, a gallery, and a contact forms page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hosting Costs: $200 \u2013 $600<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Website hosting services provide the tools and technologies that allow you to create the website in the first place. This might be the only thing you\u2019ll need to pay for your DIY website. Think of it as renting a property where you can put your stuff in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most well-known website hosting providers are GoDaddy and Bluehost (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluehost.com\/wordpress\/woocommerce-hosting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluehost\u2019s WooCommerce plans<\/a> are a great place to start.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design Costs: $0<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you\u2019re creating your own website, you\u2019re in control of how much it costs to build and maintain it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get design elements, such as media and typography elements online for free. Google has plenty of free fonts, while websites like Unsplash and Pexels offer free images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Development Costs: $0<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can develop your own website if you have enough technical know-how, but most business owners wouldn\u2019t.
