Because of this, they could already be interested or willing to help you in any way they can. All that\u2019s left to do is ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-email-example\">Email Example<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you\u2019re sending an email asking for a testimonial, it needs to be concise, yet polite. A long email will confuse the sendee, and a rude email will turn them away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, these are the two highest priorities when sending an email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a template email for your reference:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear ____,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Would you be alright with writing us a short testimonial?

You might want it to be more formal than it already is, or more conversational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, no matter how they respond, following this guideline will allow you to get what you came for nine times out of ten &#8212; a testimonial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-third-party-sites-for-testimonials\">Use Third-Party Sites for Testimonials<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to have your customers use third-party websites where they can leave testimonials or reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these third-party sites can vary depending on the industry you\u2019re in, there are many common platforms that you can rely on, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Business<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G2<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yelp<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/foursquare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foursquare<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TripAdvisor<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zomato<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this will allow you to broaden the exposure your website receives while adding another layer of authenticity to your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By maintaining your profile on third-party sites, you can show audiences that you are a legitimate business by having recent photos, current information, and top reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, having an active account that shows up-to-date information will boost results within search engines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, you\u2019ll gain the attention of more people and attract more visitors to your company and brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with this, third-party websites will usually display snippets to visually represent your website as soon as search results come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus review source \u2013 social media testimonials!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through your social media feed to see what feedback previous consumers have shared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great way to collect feedback from real people as well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure your customer is okay with you sharing their thoughts as you want to continue to build trust for your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER 5<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How are Testimonials Written?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to write the testimonial on behalf of your customers, and they usually appreciate this as well, as it\u2019s one less thing for them to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When writing the testimonial, here are a few tips, as well as some client testimonial examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg\" alt=\"Concise testimonial 1\" class=\"wp-image-35453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Concise testimonial 1<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-only-include-testimonials-that-have-been-received-ethically\">Only Include Testimonials that Have Been Received Ethically<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably another obvious piece of advice but we\u2019ll say it anyway: Don\u2019t invent fake testimonials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every testimonial on your website should be 100% authentic.

class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What&#8217;s the Anatomy of an Effective Testimonial?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>While having testimonials is great, you shouldn\u2019t just post them for the sake of having them on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to make sure that we have a few key components in place to ensure that you don\u2019t lose your credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few things to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-it-relevant\">Is it Relevant?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to check if the testimonial actually talks about your business \u2014 it\u2019s easy to fill pages with testimonials but do they actually matter to your business today?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that they capture your audiences\u2019 attention by picking out only the most relevant pieces for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A relevant testimonial will talk about the specific products and services you offer or anything new that you will soon be offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will also remain consistent regarding who you are as a company and what you represent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, potential customers can get a better sense of what you have to offer and whether or not you&#8217;re the right fit for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you&#8217;re creating or updating your testimonial pages, keep these things in mind and choose testimonials that will actually add value to your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-there-an-identifiable-source\">Is there an Identifiable Source?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, a credible testimonial will come from a source that you can identify and shouldn\u2019t be anonymous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For B2B companies, a testimonial will ideally have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A person\u2019s name<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Their job title<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Their company<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Their photo<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if some of your existing customers don\u2019t want to include a photo, a logo of their company would suffice as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example of what a testimonial for B2B companies with an identifiable source should look like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"400\"

In just two months, I&#8217;ve lost 10 pounds!&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-testimonials\">What are testimonials?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A testimonial is a statement from a satisfied customer that praises a company&#8217;s products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testimonials can be published in print or online, and they provide valuable social proof for businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can be a valuable part of a company\u2019s content marketing efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has shown that testimonials are one of the most effective forms of marketing, as they help to build trust and credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies use testimonials on their websites and in their marketing materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, testimonials can also be used in more creative ways, such as testimonial videos or testimonial parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/shopify-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify store<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce website<\/a>, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-corporate-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B website<\/a>, you can use testimonials to improve customer satisfaction and build brand loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only can testimonials increase a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">site\u2019s conversion rate<\/a> for organic traffic, they can also increase paid traffic conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are doing Facebook advertising, Instagram ads, or Google ads, the traffic from these will almost always convert better if your landing page features client testimonial examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider using different testimonial types and having some sort of process to AB test them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-i-write-a-testimonial\">How do I write a testimonial?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A testimonial is a written or recorded statement that supports the credibility of a product, service, or person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used correctly, testimonials can be extremely powerful marketing tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some testimonials are general statements of satisfaction, others are more specific, outlining the exact ways in which a product or service has helped the customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best testimonials are those that are believable, relevant, and persuasive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to write an effective testimonial, you should first take some time to consider what you want to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the specific benefits of the product or service that you\u2019re endorsing? How has it helped you in your business or personal life?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have a clear idea of what you want to communicate, you can start writing your testimonial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to include specific details and examples to back up your claims. And avoid making any exaggerations or false claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you follow these marketing tips, you can write a testimonial that will be both relevant and convincing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-testimonial-review\">What is a testimonial review?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A testimonial review is a type of review that provides first-hand accounts of a product or service from consumers who have used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional reviews, testimonial reviews are not written by professional reviewers or experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they are written by everyday people who have purchased and used the product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testimonial reviews can be found on many different websites, including product review sites, eCommerce sites, and even social media platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the rise of user-generated content, testimonial reviews have become an increasingly popular way for consumers to learn about new products and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they are not written by experts, testimonial reviews offer a more relatable and down-to-earth perspective than traditional reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-is-better-woocommerce-or-shopify\">Which is better, WooCommerce or Shopify?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing WooCommerce vs Shopify, there is no clear winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each platform has pros and cons, and it comes down to what matters most to you and what you are trying to do with your store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B eCommerce website<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/beauty-and-cosmetic-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beauty brand<\/a>, you\u2019ll need to dig in deep to understand each eCommerce platform and what it offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/woocommerce-vs-shopify\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article comparing WooCommerce and Shopify<\/a> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-you-redesign-my-website-including-the-checkout-page\">Can you redesign my website, including the checkout page?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website redesigns<\/a> are one of our primary specialties. No matter which eCommerce site you\u2019re on, we can redesign your entire site, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/?s=about+us+page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">about us page<\/a>, checkout page, product pages, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/design-category-pages-that-drive-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">category pages<\/a>, and blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-paid-or-fake-testimonials-illegal\">Are paid or fake testimonials illegal?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Testimonials are a common feature on many websites, providing first-hand accounts of how a product or service has helped others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While testimonials can be genuine and helpful, there is also the potential for companies to use fake or paid testimonials in order to boost their sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paid testimonials are those where the person giving the testimonial has been compensated in some way by the company. This could be in the form of money, free products, or other benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fake testimonials, on the other hand, are those that have been fabricated entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both types of testimonials can be misleading to consumers and give companies an unfair advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that all testimonials must be truthful and not misleading in any way. This means that companies must disclose if a testimonial is paid for and cannot make claims that are not supported by evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FTC also has rules about endorsements, which includes testimonials. These endorsements must reflect the honest opinions and experiences of the endorser, and endorsers must disclose any material connections they have with the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-further-reading-on-website-design-and-development\">Further Reading On Website Design and Development.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for web development and design inspiration?
