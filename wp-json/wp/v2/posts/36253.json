Switching domain names is no easy task, but with the right approach, it can be done seamlessly and without much negative SEO impact, if any at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-the-new-tlds-worth-it\">Are The New TLDs Worth It?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are ton of options available for someone looking to purchase a new domain name \u2013 but are these new options worth it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several months ago I got an email about all of these new, fancy TLDs (top level domains) available on the market. Scrolling through the <strong>.ninja<\/strong>s and <strong>.guru<\/strong>s made me excited to see all of these new options available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the SEO in me was skeptical. \u201cJeff, will these things even rank!?\u201d.&nbsp; I turned to Google and searched for information on the topic of switching to these new domain names. However, since these domain extensions were still a relatively new thing, there wasn\u2019t really anything out there as a valuable proof-point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided to make ourselves the test subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-huemor-rocks-why-not-agency-design-or-anything-else\">Why Jorban.rocks? Why not .agency, .design, or anything else?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw the domain name \u201chuemor.rocks\u201d available and fell in love with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve changed our methodologies and processes, added services, and really focused on \u201cwho we are,\u201d as a company. \u201cHuemor.rocks\u201d aligned very closely with how we feel, and how we want every client we work with to feel too. We\u2019re honest, we\u2019re hard-working, we\u2019re excited to do what we do, we\u2019re not intimidated by challenges, we\u2019re Jorban, and we rock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with the branding play behind us, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web redesign<\/a> underway, we figured it was a good enough reason to take the risk and switch over from huemordesigns.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-we-planned-for-the-domain-name-switch\">How We Planned For The Domain Name Switch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-we-started-with-a-reverse-redirect\">We Started With A Reverse Redirect<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By reverse redirect, I mean we started out by pointing Jorban.rocks to huemordesigns.com. &nbsp;The intention of this was, while we worked on other aspects of this plan we could actively build links to Jorban.rocks instead of huemordesigns.com. It\u2019s uncertain if this helped, but it\u2019s also a possibility that this immediately helped link the two sites together, even though it was in the opposite direction from what our final intentions would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-external-links\">External Links<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the new links we were building to Jorban.rocks, we also mapped out all of the external links that were pointing to huemordesigns.com. Social media platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/reviewgrower.com\/local-citation-finder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">local citations<\/a>, external portfolio links, publications, industry ranking sites etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly, we started to update these links to specify \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/<\/a>\u201d which at the time, was re-directing to \u201chuemordesigns.com\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-internal-redirects\">Internal Redirects<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a slightly different approach to how we routed redirects for this website. Rather than just writing a blanketed 301 redirect from huemordesigns.com to Jorban.rocks, we mapped out full path redirects for every individual page. We achieved this by maintaining a host for \u201chuemordesigns.com\u201d and adding in an .htaccess file that specified re-directs such as: \/work\/ to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/case-studies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/work\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, we were able to maintain the individual page authority transfers, rather than just directing the entire domain and letting Google redistribute the wealth themselves (this little trick allowed all of our pages to show up re-indexed a lot faster).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-micro-data-schema\">Micro Data \/ Schema<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrote fresh structured data that established our brand info (company name, phone number, email, address, social media platforms) and linked it to our .rocks domain. We believe this was key in getting search engines to quickly recognize our new name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-optimizing-the-home-page\">Optimizing The Home Page<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We made sure that our home page referenced our brand name in its meta-title and description. A small, and possibly obvious step but one we took nonetheless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-webmaster-tools\">Webmaster Tools<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a properly configured webmaster tools account helps Google (or Bing, if you\u2019re into that) apply changes to your websites quicker. What we were majorly concerned about was:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing properties for all variants of Jorban.rocks (https vs http, www. vs non-www.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preparing the notation in our huemordesigns.com variations to let them know huemordesigns.com is now Jorban.rocks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding a new sitemap to our primary website variation (<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-google-analytics-properties\">Google Analytics Properties<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not really linked to SEO goals specifically, but part of our overall marketing strategy. We created a brand new property for the .rocks domain and reconfigured the necessary filters and goals that come along with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-purchasing-variations-to-the-name\">Purchasing Variations to the Name<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this wasn\u2019t directly linked to the SEO goals of the website, but more of a usability concern. We wanted to make sure that individuals who might be confused by our name could still find us on a direct visit. We bought stuff like \u201chuemorrocks.com\u201d, \u201chuemor.com\u201d, \u201chumorrocks.com\u201d etc, and made sure it was pointed at our .rocks domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-post-launch\">Post Launch<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So after all of those boxes were checked off, we made the switch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did we see happen to our rankings? Initially nothing. That was awesome! No-post launch dip, no SERP dance, nothing. It was as if nothing ever happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of our organic traffic prior to launch and an example of it immediately after launch. Over time, however, we noticed that our organic traffic was rising. We began to rank for more and more keywords. Things have continued to trend that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-post-launch-update-2-years-later\">Post Launch Update \u2013 2 Years Later<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years since our switch to Jorban.rocks, and our traffic has steadily increased month-over-month, year-over-year. It&#8217;s also continued to be a differentiator and talking point for our firm. Further goes to show that the TLD you choose doesn&#8217;t directly impact SEO in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"699\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1-300x205.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1-768x524.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1-36x25.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Huemor-Rocks-1024x699-1-48x33.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-did-we-learn\">What Did We Learn?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading ServicesSlider-header small\" id=\"h-don-t-be-afraid-to-switch-domains\">Don\u2019t be afraid to switch domains<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to switch to a new domain name, don\u2019t be afraid, be cautious instead. Think about how all the aspects the switch will affect and how you can minimize any negative effects. Ultimately, if you take the time to do it right, you\u2019re not going to see a disturbing drop-off in traffic. In our case, we saw literally zero change in our traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading ServicesSlider-header small\" id=\"h-your-tld-doesn-t-matter-to-search-engines\">Your TLD doesn\u2019t matter to search engines<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your TLD doesn\u2019t matter in the eyes of Google and Bing. They\u2019re concerned with your content, and your signals. I believe that .com dominating SERPs is related more to their commonality, and relative age compared to newer TLDs. Independent of site optimization, an older domain has been proven to be a positive ranking signal. Moreover, most top websites have been optimized on .com domains over the course of years, resulting in more of them floating to the top. As time moves forward, I believe you\u2019ll see (good) variations of TLDs more frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading ServicesSlider-header small\" id=\"h-your-tld-matters-to-some-email-providers\">Your TLD matters to some email providers<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Email providers, and more specifically, spam filters, are still touch-and-go on non-.com TLDs. Make sure when switching you verify your domain name, and also, add proper SPF records to combat email spam. Even then, depending on your customer base you might want to maintain a .com TLD for email correspondence. I\u2019m a pretty firm believer that this will get better once adoption increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/domainnamewire.com\/category\/podcasts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Changing Your Website\u2019s Domain Name&#8221;<\/a> podcast!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s an article detailing how we at Jorbanchanged our website from huemordesigns.com to Jorban.rocks, as well as the branding hurdles we faced.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":43181,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":""},"categories":[30],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v20.9 (Yoast SEO v20.13) -
