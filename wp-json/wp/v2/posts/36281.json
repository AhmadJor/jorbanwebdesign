For example, a metric could be the number of sales made in a month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some important metrics for eCommerce businesses include the number of visitors to the website, the number of sales made, the average order value, and the conversion rate. By tracking these metrics, businesses can identify trends and patterns that can be used to improve the overall performance of the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking metrics can also help businesses to benchmark their performance against other businesses in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are KPIs?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An eCommerce KPI (key performance indicator) is a metric that helps you understand whether you\u2019re achieving your business goals. Without KPIs, it would be difficult to gauge whether your marketing campaigns are successful or if your product is resonating with your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you want to increase website sales by 10%. Your KPI could be the percentage of visitors to your website who make a purchase. By tracking this metric, you can see whether your goal is being met and make changes accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All eCommerce KPIs are metrics, but not all metrics are KPIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing a KPI, it is important to select one that is measurable, quantifiable, and actionable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A measurable KPI is one that can be tracked and monitored over time. This could include metrics such as website traffic or sales conversion rates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A quantifiable KPI is one that can be expressed in numerical terms. This could include the number of new customers acquired or the percentage of target market reach<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An actionable KPI is one that can be used to drive business decisions. This could include the rate of customer satisfaction or the number of repeat purchases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By selecting a KPI with these attributes, businesses can ensure that they are choosing a metric that will provide valuable insights into their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, so take some time to consider what eCommerce metrics will best help you reach your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vanity Metrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A vanity metric is a quantitative measure that provides little to no meaningful insights but gives the false impression of progress or success. In other words, vanity metrics are those that make you feel good but don&#8217;t actually help you achieve your business goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re trying to grow your e-commerce business. You might be focused on increasing the number of website visitors, the number of social media followers, or the number of email subscribers. These are all vanity metrics because they don&#8217;t directly correlate with revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s important to track and improve upon these numbers, it&#8217;s even more important to focus on metrics that actually matter to your bottom line such as conversion rate, average order value, or customer lifetime value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next time you&#8217;re looking at your analytics dashboard, take a step back and ask yourself if the numbers you&#8217;re seeing are really helping you move closer to your goals. If not, then it might be time to start focusing on different vanity metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The Difference Between Metrics and KPIs<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As any business owner knows, setting and achieving goals is essential to success. However, it can be difficult to track progress towards a goal, especially as a company grows and becomes more complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics are both tools that businesses use to track their progress. However, there are some important differences between the two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KPIs are designed to measure progress toward a specific goal, such as increasing sales by 10 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, metrics are used to measure the overall health of a company. They can provide insights into areas such as customer satisfaction, employee retention, and financial stability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses often use both KPIs and metrics to get a complete picture of their performance. For metrics and KPIs to be helpful, they need to be measurable. If a metric or KPI can\u2019t be measured, then it\u2019s not helping you track your progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Why Are Metrics and KPIs Important for eCommerce Businesses?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know metrics and KPIs, let\u2019s talk about why they\u2019re essential for eCommerce businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics and KPIs provide a base for analyzing performance. They help determine whether you\u2019re on track to achieve your business goals. You can identify areas that need improvement by tracking the right metrics and making changes accordingly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Metrics and KPIs can be used as goals in and of themselves. For example, if your goal is to increase sales by 10% this year, your eCommerce metric could be the number of sales made or the eCommerce revenue generated.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Metrics can help understand your business customer base. By tracking how customers interact with your website, you can learn a lot about their preferences and habits. This information can then be used to tailor the content of your site to better match their needs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Metrics can help you create more targeted marketing campaigns and track your return on investment (ROI). By seeing how much revenue is generated as a result of your business\u2019s marketing efforts, you can make adjustments to ensure that your marketing campaigns are as effective as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Online stores, retailers, and other businesses use eCommerce metrics to gain helpful insights into their business performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These insights allow them to recalibrate their strategy and fix their process to improve the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How To Use Analytics For Your eCommerce Business<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, data is everything. Businesses that can harness the power of data to make informed decisions are the ones that succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re running an eCommerce business, then you need to be using analytics to make sure that you&#8217;re making the most of your opportunities. Too many businesses lack a clear understanding of their data, and as a result, they miss out on valuable insights that could help them to improve their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are eCommerce Analytics?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data about an online business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce analytics can provide businesses with valuable insights into shopping trends, customer behavior and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. By understanding what customers want and how they shop, businesses can make more informed decisions about product offerings, pricing and promotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce analytics can also help businesses to identify areas where their website or shopping experience could be improved. By understanding what is happening at every stage of the customer journey, businesses can optimize their eCommerce site to encourage more sales and happier customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are eCommerce Analytics Important?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce analytics are essential for understanding how customers interact with your online store. By tracking data such as page views, add-to-carts, and conversion rates, you can uncover trends and optimize your store to boost sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, eCommerce analytics can help you better understand your customers by tracking their demographics, behaviors, and interests. This information can be used to segment your customer base and create targeted marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, eCommerce analytics can be used to analyze data from online sales transactions in order to make better business decisions. This data can include things like the number of items sold, the average order value, shipping costs, and return rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking this information over time, eCommerce businesses can identify trends and patterns that can help them improve their bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What eCommerce Metrics To Track?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you now know what ecommerce metrics are and how important they are to your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to dive deeper but don\u2019t know where to start. Don\u2019t worry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When assessing the performance of your eCommerce business, it is important to consider a variety of metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Traffic and site usage metrics can provide insights into how customers are interacting with the site, while marketing metrics can reveal the effectiveness of promotional campaigns<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Financial metrics, such as sales and revenue, are also critical for understanding the bottom-line impact of e-commerce operations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performance metrics, such as customer satisfaction or employee productivity, can also be informative<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Complex metrics like the multi-dimensional scorecards can provide a comprehensive overview of performance by integrating data from multiple sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that some of these metrics may not be applicable to your business. Choose and measure the metrics that you think will help your business in the short and long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll explain each of them in more detail below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">eCommerce Website Traffic And Site Usage Metrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Website traffic metrics are measures of the amount of activity on a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common metric is page views, which counts the number of times a page is loaded by a visitor. Other common metrics include ad views or ad impressions, which measure how many times an advertisement is displayed, and visits, which counts the number of times a site is accessed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique visitors is another common metric, which measures the number of distinct individuals who visit a site over a certain period of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website traffic metrics are typically used to assess the success of a website in terms of its ability to generate interest and attract visitors. They can also be used to identify areas where a website may be struggling, such as in terms of its <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web design<\/a> or content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site usage metrics provide website owners and administrators with valuable insights about the traffic sources and how their site is being used. By analyzing site usage data, they can identify patterns and trends that can help them to improve the user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, spatial usage analysis can reveal which areas of the site are most popular with visitors and where they tend to spend the most time. This information can be used to optimize the layout of the site and ensure that the most important content is more visible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Temporal site usage analysis can identify when users visit the site and how long they stay. Such information can be useful to correlate with the timing of promotions or website changes to determine their efficacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to website traffic, there are a lot of different metrics that you can track. However, some metrics are more important than others. Here are three of the most important website traffic and site usage metrics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sessions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A website session is defined as the period of time a user spends on a website between their first click and their last. It&#8217;s a metric that can be used to measure the effectiveness of a website in engaging users and keeping them glued to their screens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website&#8217;s bounce rate, which is the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page, is also affected by the length of sessions. The longer a user stays on a site, the more likely they are to explore it fully, or make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several ways to improve website sessions, such as by installing engaging visual elements, offering smooth navigation, and providing compelling content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By increasing the length of time users spend on your site, you can lower your bounce rate and improve your chances of converting visitors into customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bounce Rate<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Bounce-Rate.jpg\" alt=\"Bounce Rate\" class=\"wp-image-32984\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors to a website who leave the site after viewing only one page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bounce rate is one of the most significant eCommerce key metrics because it can indicate a navigation problem on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high bounce rate might mean that your website\u2019s design is not attractive or user-friendly and that you might need to redesign your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sales funnel stage is also an important factor to consider when evaluating your bounce rate. If people are bouncing at the top of the funnel, it may be a sign that your site isn&#8217;t relevant to their needs. However, if they&#8217;re bouncing at the bottom of the funnel, it may be a sign that there&#8217;s a problem with your checkout process. By understanding where people are bouncing on your site, you can make changes to improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/ecommerce-conversion-funnel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eCommerce conversion funnel<\/a> and lower your bounce rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Analytics is the best way to track your website\u2019s bounce rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Analytics will show how many people visit your website and how long they stay on each page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By looking at this data, you can see which pages have high bounce rates and take steps to improve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to ensure your website is user-friendly and attractive, keep an eye on your bounce rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp2.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4E03AQEzirYnFEIipw\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200\/0\/1620339888208?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=V4Ul35FzsS_ilh9J1q95zYrnfPfqSBsly197okII7RU\" alt=\"Christi Carnahan\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>It&#8217;s important to note that with the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/10089681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">next generation of Google Analytics (GA4)<\/a>, metrics are focused more on events and actions than past versions.

A high CTR indicates that people are interested in what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, a low CTR may suggest that your website or ad needs improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving your CTR can significantly impact your business, so it\u2019s worth taking the time to track and improve this metric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formula: CTR = (# of Clicks \/ # of Views\/Impressions) x 100<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">eCommerce Marketing Metrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An important aspect of digital marketing is understanding and measuring marketing metrics: the performance of marketing campaigns and marketing strategy both for B2C and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-corporate-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B<\/a> eCommerce brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, marketing metrics were largely based on guesswork and intuition. However, with the advent of CRM systems like <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/hubspot-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HubSpot<\/a>, and marketing automation tools, sophisticated customer-focused methods have been developed for gathering important marketing information that will improve eCommerce conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing metrics can be used to track various aspects of a marketing campaign, such as customer acquisition, net promoter score (NPS), subscription rates, conversion rates, engagement levels, and ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different types of marketing metrics, but some common ones include location analysis, customer profile analysis, and shopping basket analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Location analysis looks at where customers are located and how this affects their purchase behavior<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customer profile analysis examines the demographics and psychographics of customers to identify trends and patterns<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shopping basket analysis tracks the items that customers add to their shopping carts, in order to understand what kind of products they are interested in.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding which KPIs to track and how these metrics interact, eCommerce store owners can make data-driven decisions about their marketing efforts. In today&#8217;s competitive marketplace, this is more important than ever before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">eCommerce Financial Metrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of different financial metrics related to finance that businesses use to track their performance. Financial metrics are important tools that businesses use to measure their success. The most common financial metrics are revenue, expenses, and ROI (return on investment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue is the total amount of money that a business brings in from sales<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expenses are the costs associated with running the business, such as rent, inventory, and payroll<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ROI is a measure of how much profit a business makes relative to its investment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While revenue and ROI are certainly important eCommerce metrics, they are by no means the only metrics worth tracking. There are several other important eCommerce financial metrics\u2014such as sales conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, or average order value\u2014that eCommerce businesses should track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking financial metrics and focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversion rate optimization<\/a>, businesses can gain a better understanding of their overall financial health and make informed decisions about how to allocate their resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sales Conversion Rate<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Sales-Conversion-Rate.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Conversion Rate\" class=\"wp-image-32979\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The sales conversion rate (CVR) is the number of people who bought something on your website out of everyone who visited your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So get your website traffic data ready to go to determine how well your eCommerce store is doing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why the sales conversion rate is essential:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>To know if site visitors are making a purchase or visiting the site. If you have a low CVR, it could mean that something is wrong with your website, and that\u2019s why people aren\u2019t converting into customers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is your website doing you a service and getting you sales? A low CVR could indicate that something needs to be fixed on your website for it to be more effective in generating sales.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the other hand, a high CVR could mean that your website is compelling and brings in a decent amount of sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the higher your sales conversion rate, the better. However, there is no magic number that all eCommerce websites should aim for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for ways to improve your eCommerce sales, it is important to track your CVR over time and look for trends. If you see a sudden drop in your CVR, that could indicate that something on your website needs to be fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Formula<\/strong>: CVR = # of purchases made \/ # of visitors<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customer Lifetime Value<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Customer-Lifetime-Value.jpg\" alt=\"Customer Lifetime Value\" class=\"wp-image-32981\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The customer lifetime value (CTV) is the total amount of money a customer will spend on your website throughout their lifetime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are a few reasons why CTV is important:<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It helps you know how much each customer is worth to your business. This information can be used to make decisions about marketing and product development.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Knowing your customers\u2019 CTV, you can calculate how much you can afford to spend on acquiring new customers. For example, suppose you know that the average customer pays $100 on your site over their lifetime. In that case, you can spend up to $100 on acquiring a new customer and still break even.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>LTV can also help you predict future revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you know the LTV of your customers, you can estimate how much income you\u2019ll generate in the future based on the number of current customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LTV is an essential metric for eCommerce businesses because it helps them understand how much each customer is worth and predict future revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Formula<\/strong>: CTV = Average Value of a Purchase x # of Times the Customer Will Buy Each Year x Average Length of the Customer Relationship (in Years)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Average Order Value<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Average-Order-Value.jpg\" alt=\"Average Order Value\" class=\"wp-image-32982\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Average Order Value (AOV) is a key eCommerce metric that measures the average amount spent per order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric is critical to track because it can give you insight into the health of your business and help you set realistic goals for revenue growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few different ways to calculate AOV. The most common is simply to take your total revenue for a given period and divide it by the number of orders placed during that period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your eCommerce store generated $100,000 in sales over a month and you had 10,000 orders during that same timeframe, your AOV would be $10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AOV is a reasonably straightforward metric, it can be advantageous in several ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your AOV can give you an idea of how much each sale is worth to your company. This is vital information to have when setting goals for revenue growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AOV is a reasonably simple metric, it can provide valuable insights into the health of your eCmmerce business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking your AOV over time, you can identify customer spending trends and set realistic revenue growth goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Formula<\/strong>: AOV = Total Revenue \/ Total Number of Orders<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Shopping-Cart-Abandonment-Rate.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate\" class=\"wp-image-32983\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the percentage of people who add items to their cart but don\u2019t make a purchase. There are a number of reasons why people may abandon their cart, such as high refund and return rates, unexpected shipping costs, or difficulty in checkout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking this metric is essential because it can give you insights into why people are not completing purchases on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be many reasons why this is happening, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>High shipping costs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Complicated checkout process<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lack of payment options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding why people are abandoning their carts, you can make changes to your site that will encourage more people to complete their purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refunds and returns are one of the biggest reasons people abandon their carts. Whether it&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve changed their mind about the purchase, or they&#8217;re not happy with the quality of the product, refunds and returns can discourage people from completing a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to combat this is by offering a small refund or return policy. This shows customers that you&#8217;re confident in your product and that you&#8217;re willing to stand behind it. Additionally, you can offer loyalty programs that give customers a discount on future purchases. This helps to build customer trust and loyalty, and encourages them to complete their purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate your shopping cart abandonment rate, simply divide the number of abandoned carts by the total number of transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you had 100 abandoned carts and 1,000 complete transactions, your shopping cart abandonment rate would be 10%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a high shopping cart abandonment rate can be frustrating, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not always bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes people add items to their cart but decide they don\u2019t want them after all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these cases, the customer has saved themselves from making a purchase they would have regretted (and possibly returned) later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Formula<\/strong>: Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate = (# of Completed Purchases \/ # of Shopping Carts Created) x 100<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER six<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How eCommerce Metrics Dashboard Can Help You Track Metrics and KPIs<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>An eCommerce metrics dashboard is a collection of metrics that helps eCommerce businesses track and analyze their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashboard typically includes a variety of KPIs that can give insights into areas such as website traffic, conversion rate, and customer satisfaction.
