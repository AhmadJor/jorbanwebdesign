Now what? How do you persuade users to click and read it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, determine what kind of copywriting style works best for your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t merely write whatever you want and hope people like it; you have to figure out how to connect with them in the best way possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where voice, tone, messaging, and the audience come into play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice refers to how you talk about yourself or your product. It\u2019s how you want people to feel when they\u2019re reading about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tone is the attitude that comes through in every word. Is it friendly? Informal? Serious? Your tone should reflect how you want customers to perceive your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messaging is how you convey information about yourself or your product. The words on the page are just one part of the story! The other part involves the attitude behind those words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the audience refers to who is reading this content. Who are they? Why should they be interested in what I\u2019m saying? What do they want from me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Guidelines, Guidelines, &amp; More Guidelines<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Guidelines-Guidelines-More-Guidelines@2x-1024x660-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the best way to ensure that your copy is on point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create branding guidelines and copy guidelines. These documents will help keep your brand consistent across all mediums, including social media posts and website copy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips for creating copy guidelines for your site:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be specific<\/strong>: Don\u2019t just say, \u201cmake it fun and friendly.\u201d Define what that means.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make them easy to understand and use<\/strong>: If someone else has questions about the brand or wants to make changes, they can do it quickly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Include examples<\/strong>: You need examples of how the brand should look and feel on all channels (print, social media, web).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make it accurate<\/strong>: Anytime a new piece of content is created (like a blog post or an email), check it against your brand guidelines to ensure it follows them properly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be consistent<\/strong>: Don\u2019t forget about consistency, especially when it comes to tone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lose the \u201cWe\u201d, \u201cOur Company\u201d, and \u201cCompany Name\u201d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re writing for a website, it can be easy to forget that the user is the hero of the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user needs to be the person who succeeds \u2014 with your help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t write copy that makes that clear, it\u2019s easy to fall into an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality, where your company is trying to sell something to a customer who doesn\u2019t know what they need or is interested in buying from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to remember that your job as a copywriter isn\u2019t just about selling your products and services; it\u2019s about helping people solve problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone visits your website looking for information about a certain topic, make sure you\u2019re talking directly to them about their problem and not just listing off the features of your product or service without addressing why those features matter for them specifically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customers are looking for a particular experience when they come to your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can tell whether or not you\u2019ve created it based on how well the words on your site speak to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for those words to resonate, you need to make an effort to talk with the potential customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus should be on features and real benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Features are what make up a product or service \u2014 the things that are technically true about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benefits are why people want those features \u2014 what they expect from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real benefits are what actually happens when someone uses those features in their lives (or business).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be Relatable to Your Target Audience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your target audience is one way of applying your copywriting best practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing copy for a website isn\u2019t just about ensuring you have all the correct information; it\u2019s about being transparent, hitting your user where it matters, and making a connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with figuring out what they want and why they want it. You must ensure that you\u2019re addressing the pain points of the people who will be viewing your site and filling out your forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it would be beneficial if you did it in a way that would make them feel safe \u2014 like they could trust you with their information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all been frustrated when trying to learn new stuff, and there are too many obstacles to jump through or insufficient information on where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s frustrating!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to use this frustration as an opportunity for humor.
