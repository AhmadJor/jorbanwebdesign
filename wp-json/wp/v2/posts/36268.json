Here are the common culprits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web hosting isn\u2019t properly set up<\/strong>: If your web hosting server isn\u2019t configured correctly, then it\u2019ll greatly affect your website\u2019s speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>WordPress configuration<\/strong>: If your website is overloading your server, then it\u2019ll slow down your website. In extreme cases, your website may entirely crash.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Images or graphics<\/strong>: All of the images and graphics you put on your website will require some time to load fully. So, if these aren\u2019t optimized or if your site is filled with images or graphics, then it\u2019ll affect the loading speed on your web pages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plug-ins<\/strong>: Even if plug-ins can be the perfect supplement for your website, do note that they can also affect your site\u2019s loading speed. This is particularly true if you\u2019re using a poorly coded plug-in.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Additional add-ons<\/strong>: An example of additional add-ons are external scripts, such as fonts and advertisements. In the same way as images, if these aren\u2019t optimized, then they\u2019ll gravely affect your site\u2019s overall performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If too many of these are in play, you may want to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">redesigning your website<\/a>.

Hence, when designing a website, always make sure to reduce and simplify any aspects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, before launching your WordPress website, make sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-launch-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">follow our ultimate site launch checklist<\/a>. By doing so, you\u2019ll have proper guidance on the much-needed aspects to consider before launching your company website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep the following tips in mind to make WordPress faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Make Sure You Have Good Website Hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious WordPress performance optimization technique. If your website is on shared web hosting, it\u2019s a given that there are potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of other websites that compete and demand the same resources. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, it\u2019s inevitable that your site will have a frustrating loading speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small companies can always utilize shared website hosting, provided they don\u2019t have the budget yet. Just ensure that the website is hosted by a reputable provider, which often includes sufficient memory for your small website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">If you\u2019re a small-to-midsize business with low to moderate traffic, it\u2019s best to host with a WP engine.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if a website is steadily attracting around 30,000 or more monthly visitors, it\u2019s recommended to move your site to a dedicated server. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative for a dedicated service is a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Nevertheless, both types of servers aim to prevent other websites from hogging the same sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A common reason why your website loads slowly is due to real-world distance. In other words, your web pages will tend to load slowly if they\u2019re accessed by someone who\u2019s far away from your server\u2019s physical location. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if your business targets international users as well as those in remote areas, you have to keep this factor in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To lessen the impact of real-world distance to your website, use a Content Delivery Network (CDN). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CDN essentially adds caching layers to reduce the number of assets a web visitor needs to load so they can access your page\u2019s information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro tip: we recommend using Cloudflare as a CDN. Not only is Cloudflare a reputable CDN, but it also provides astounding <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-security-issues-and-concerns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">security features<\/a>, which your WordPress website absolutely needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Audit Your Site and Remove What You No Longer Need<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Audit-Your-Site-and-Remove-What-You-No-Longer-Need.jpg\" alt=\"Audit Your Site and Remove What You No Longer Need\" class=\"wp-image-32370\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More isn\u2019t always better when <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing a website<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any content, image, and text on every web page you have are pieces of information that need to load when a web visitor is on your website. A surplus of content and media may make your website load slowly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have a faster WordPress site, audit your website. Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce store<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-corporate-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B website<\/a>, examine all of your site\u2019s elements and determine if they\u2019re necessary to deliver your message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a piece of content, image, or text is no longer effective, delete it from your site. You can also do the same for any outdated or useless information on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve your WordPress performance, follow these tips when auditing your site:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>As much as possible, show excerpts of posts instead of their full version.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limit the number of posts on every web page between five to seven.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Remove both inactive plug-ins and widgets.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your website neat and minimal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For your reference, here are <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/great-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">24 examples of what an attractive website looks like<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Optimize Images<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3743993\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research<\/a> shows that using colorful visuals make visitors 80% more likely to read your site\u2019s content. Hence, images won\u2019t only eliminate the unappealing nature that blocks of texts bring, but they can also breathe life into your content, boosting engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this isn\u2019t an invitation to fill your web page with images or simply use any image without prior consideration. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you may resort to using uncompressed images because they\u2019re sharper and of high quality. But their file size is also large, slowing down your website\u2019s performance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, if images aren\u2019t optimized, then they\u2019ll hurt your site\u2019s loading speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if using non-optimized images is the common reason why beginner websites load slowly, you don\u2019t have to suffer the same consequences. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, make sure to consider these tips when selecting images for your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose the Right Image Format<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An image is categorized into the following formats: SVG, PNG, and JPG. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a simple logo or icon, make sure it\u2019s in the SVG format. If an image requires background transparency, opt for the PNG format. Lastly, you can use the JPG format for all other images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compress Image Files<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since uncompressed images affect your site\u2019s loading speed, you must compress image files before uploading them to your site\u2019s pages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An easy way to compress image files is to use the \u201cSave for Web\u201d command in Adobe Photoshop. Take note that you should adjust the image to the smallest file size possible when using this command. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, don\u2019t forget to keep an eye out for the image quality; lowering the file size may result in pixelated images, affecting their quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Adobe Photoshop, the locations of important factors when compressing your image files (quality, format, optimization, color, as well as downsizing and sharpening) are in the top right-hand corner except for the \u201cExpected file size,\u201d which is located in the bottom, left-hand corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be Mindful of the Number of Images Used<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have the right image format and size, it\u2019s still important not to go overboard when adding images to your web pages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because each image on your website will create request loops, each of which will take some time to process, affecting your site\u2019s loading speed despite following the tips to optimize your images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Make Sure Everything&#8217;s Up-to-Date<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Make-Sure-Everythings-Up-to-Date.jpg\" alt=\"Make Sure Everythings Up to Date\" class=\"wp-image-32371\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates aren\u2019t just meant to add new features, improve security, and fix bugs. But any updates may also improve your site\u2019s performance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, if any elements of your company website aren\u2019t up-to-date, or you\u2019re running a less optimized version of WordPress, then your site will load poorly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a solution, regularly check if your WordPress website is currently updated. This also means you should check for updates in any themes or plug-ins you use. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, don\u2019t forget to have your PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) updated. PHP is the language that powers any WordPress website, which means that they need to be updated so your site\u2019s speed and performance will improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your current website is filled with outdated information and you\u2019re planning to redesign it, read our tips concerning <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-redesign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to plan for a site redesign<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Plan Ahead and Schedule Background Tasks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any background tasks, such as updating your website, running any security checks, or performing website backups, will slow down your website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, your site will significantly load if it has a high volume of traffic while running some background tasks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, conducting updates during your site\u2019s peak traffic times isn\u2019t advisable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this doesn\u2019t contradict the necessity of regularly updating your website, as stated above. Instead, you should focus and plan when you should perform updates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you should update your website during off-traffic times. Also, don\u2019t forget to have a regular schedule for these tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Comments From Visitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your WordPress website has a blog section, then you may have some comments left by visitors. Having an interactive comment section is one of the signs that your content generates engagement, which is a good thing for your company. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a busy comment section will bring performance issues, slowing down your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A database is queried to retract existing comments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Database entries are created automatically for every new comment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Both comments and comment metadata are processed and received by a visitor\u2019s browser.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>More often than not, large JavaScript and jQuery resources need to be downloaded and processed so your site\u2019s commenting system will function efficiently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since a commenting system promotes engagement, you shouldn\u2019t remove it from your site just so you can enjoy a fast loading speed. Instead, apply the following tips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paginate Your Comments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Paginating your comments essentially means creating a page break for comments. This way, every comment doesn\u2019t need to load on a single page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can <a href=\"https:\/\/wpengine.com\/resources\/paginate-wordpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paginate your comments<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Login to your WordPress admin area and then go to Settings, then the discussions page.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once you\u2019re on the discussions page, find the \u201cbreak comments into pages\u201d option. Once you find this option, enter the number of comments you want each page to display as well as how you want them to be displayed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click \u201cSave Changes\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To check if your comments are paginated, visit any post on your website, specifically those that have a lot of comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eliminate Avatars<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although avatars bring personalization, it\u2019s best not to allow your site\u2019s commenters to use them. Every avatar will cause another request to be run, which only slows down your site\u2019s speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limit Use of Images and Video in Comments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to avatars, images, videos, or other embeds will also cause another request to be run. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these help your commenters in various ways, it\u2019s best not to completely eliminate them. Instead, just set a limit on their usage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Audio and Videos Files<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Audio-and-Videos-Files.jpg\" alt=\"Audio and Videos Files\" class=\"wp-image-32372\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating both your audio and video files is important when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">improving your website without completely redesigning it<\/a>. The need to update these types of files stems from the fact that audio and video files have huge file sizes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to images, huge file sizes may affect your site\u2019s loading speed. Thus, if audio and video files aren\u2019t necessary, it\u2019s best to avoid adding them to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you need video on your website, ensure that you follow strict file size limits \u2013\u2013 of around 30MB uncompressed. We also suggest preventing the video from natively loading on your WordPress website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an alternative, you can host both audio and video files on another platform, then encode their respective URL to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another suggestion we highly recommend is to use Vimeo, which is a very popular and affordable third-party video hosting platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vimeo also provides users more freedom over its user interface, which is not the case in other video hosts like Youtube.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Your Theme Matters A Lot<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website\u2019s theme will affect speed and performance based on the theme per se. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you\u2019re using third-party themes, despite giving you the flexibility to create a visually appealing site, take note that this type of website theme will most likely lead to slower load times. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, pre-bought themes come with tons of features, some of which you won\u2019t even use. These built-in features will greatly impact your site\u2019s performance, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, when choosing a theme for your WordPress website, make sure to be specific on what you exactly need from the theme and avoid any extras or features that won\u2019t contribute to your company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Pick the Right Plug-ins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to ensure that the plug-ins you\u2019re currently using are indeed worth using. This means that plug-ins should improve your site. If they don\u2019t help with this, then it\u2019s best to remove them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that simply removing and deleting a plug-in won\u2019t suffice to successfully get rid of them. That\u2019s why you need to uninstall every unwanted plug-in, especially since WordPress stores all downloaded WordPress themes and plug-ins. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, hunt down any leftover data from every deleted plug-in. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to run some tests that aim to check if any plug-in is successfully removed from your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, knowing the right plug-ins for your site will help you avoid two following problems that they create:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>A plug-in comes pre-packaged with its own javascript and CSS, all of which will need to load on your site. Hence, the more plug-ins you have, the slower your site\u2019s loading speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In addition to quantity, the quality of plug-ins are also important. Some plug-ins may be more resource-intensive than others, which means they need more resources to load, affecting your site\u2019s speed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you want to avoid any plug-ins that provide the same function as your theme. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, don\u2019t bother installing a plug-in to create a slider on your website. Instead, resort to a custom section that\u2019s part of the theme. Doing so is a more efficient use of javascript and CSS, as well as helping you avoid duplication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. CSS and Javascript<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/CSS-and-Javascript.jpg\" alt=\"CSS and Javascript\" class=\"wp-image-32373\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if both CSS and Javascript can spruce up your website\u2019s design, both can also be the reason why your website is not performing well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enjoy the benefits that CSS and Javascript bring to your website, simply reduce the file sizes for both. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing so, you can reduce how much space both of these files take up, increasing your site\u2019s speed. A simple way to reduce the file sizes for both CSS and Javascript is to remove any unneeded comments and code within your existing code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, you can also eliminate render blocking to boost your site\u2019s performance. This means to defer the loading of both CSS and javascript wherever you can. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, ensure that your website will only load both CSS and javascript in pages that need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Reduce External HTTP Requests<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of WordPress themes and plug-ins will load different types of files from various websites. These files can be scripts, stylesheets, and images from external resources, such as Facebook, Google, analytics services, and more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since many of these types of files are already optimized to load quickly, it\u2019s safe to use a few of them. But if your plugins are already making plenty of these requests, then it\u2019ll significantly reduce your site\u2019s loading speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent any external HTTP requests from happening, you can disable styles and scripts or combine them into a single file. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/digwp.com\/2019\/03\/disable-script-style-added-plugins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tutorial<\/a> on how you can disable your plug-ins\u2019 CSS files and Javascript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether an <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/ecommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ecommerce store<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/nonprofit-and-social-cause-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nonprofit website<\/a>, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/small-and-midsized-business-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">small business website<\/a>, your WordPress website will thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Reduce Database Calls<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This tip may be a little technical and require basic knowledge of WordPress template files and PHP. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you\u2019re not confident with your own skills, make sure to call a web developer, which is different from a web designer. You can learn the difference between the two in our <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/web-design-vs-web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Design vs Web Development article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are plenty of poorly coded WordPress themes available. They\u2019re poorly coded in the sense that they ignore standard practices, which end up making direct database calls, or they make plenty of unnecessary requests to the database. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can imagine, a poorly coded WordPress theme will slow down your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, well-coded themes may also have a code that makes database calls just so it can acquire your website\u2019s basic information. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, every time you see &lt;?php, then it\u2019ll start a new database call:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;html  dir=&#8221;&lt;?php language_attributes(); ?&gt;&#8221;&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;head profile=&#8221;http:\/\/gmpg.org\/xfn\/11&#8243;&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;meta http-equiv=&#8221;Content-Type&#8221; content=&#8221;&lt;?php bloginfo(&#8216;html_type&#8217;); ?&gt;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>charset=&lt;?php bloginfo(&#8216;charset&#8217;); ?&gt;&#8221; \/&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can\u2019t blame the theme developer for this since they simply can\u2019t know what language your site is in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019re customizing your site via a child theme, you can replace these database calls with your specific information, reducing database calls. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;html  dir=&#8221;ltr&#8221;&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;head profile=&#8221;http:\/\/gmpg.org\/xfn\/11&#8243;&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;meta http-equiv=&#8221;Content-Type&#8221; content=&#8221;text\/html; charset=UTF-8&#8243; \/&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, make sure to review your parent theme so it can be replaced with static information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Optimize WordPress Database<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s inevitable that WordPress databases will become bloated. To optimize the WordPress database, make sure to remove trashed posts, both unused tags and categories, revisions, etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest using the WP-Sweep plug-in to efficiently take on this task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Caleb-square.jpg\" alt=\"Caleb square\" class=\"wp-image-29375\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>\u201cTypically, you have to choose between a site with custom backend capabilities and a site that performs well. WordPress is a platform that allows you to have the best of both worlds. When set-up properly, WordPress allows for user-friendly content management, as well as fast load times.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Caleb Shultz, Director of Projects<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Limit Stored Page\/Post Revisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To assist us in optimizing the WordPress database, you can limit the number of revisions your site can store. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do so without sacrificing any of your content, remove any post revisions. You can do this by opening the WordPress wp-config.php file. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, add the following configuration line:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>define(&#8216;WP_POST_REVISIONS&#8217;, false );<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Disable External Hotlinking of Files<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any of your popular content will find its way to other websites. Unfortunately, any videos or images that are hotlinked from other websites will leech your bandwidth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To disable external hotlinking of files, add this code to your httaccess file:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Version&#8221;: &#8220;2008-10-17&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Id&#8221;: &#8220;preventHotLinking&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Statement&#8221;: [<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sid&#8221;: &#8220;1&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Effect&#8221;: &#8220;Allow&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Principal&#8221;: {<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;AWS&#8221;: &#8220;*&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Action&#8221;: &#8220;s3:GetObject&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Resource&#8221;: &#8220;arn:aws:s3:::my-brand-new-bucket\/*&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Condition&#8221;: {<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;StringLike&#8221;: {<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;aws:Referer&#8221;: [<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;http:\/\/yourwebsitename.com\/*&#8221;,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;http:\/\/www.yourwebsitename.com\/*&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;https:\/\/google.com\/*&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;https:\/\/bing.com\/*&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;https:\/\/yahoo.com\/*&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Test Performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, make sure to conduct a test performance for your website, specifically a speed test. A test performance will allow you to know what adjustments can be made. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, test performance can provide a benchmark for your website\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to providing great insights on website performance, we highly recommend using GTMetrix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER Five<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Our Recommendations for Hosting and Plug-ins<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a trusted and reliable agency, we\u2019ve already tested plenty of plug-ins in different categories. That\u2019s why we\u2019re able to confidently provide some recommendations regarding the following. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in addition to abiding by these <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-design-standards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website design standards we follow<\/a>, consider using these hosting and plug-ins for your site, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WP engine is a relatively affordable hosting solution for WordPress websites. In addition to the various features they offer, WP engine also has a built-in caching and performance optimization, which will greatly help speed up WordPress site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a CDN that provides security and speed to your website, we highly recommend Cloudflare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caching Plug-ins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Rocket is our favorite WordPress performance plugin. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it\u2019s not free, the fact that it\u2019s head and shoulders above other plug-ins makes it a worthwhile investment. WP Rocket\u2019s minification, deferment, granular controls for caching, and pre-loading will allow your WordPress website to load as fast as lightning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Image Optimization<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We highly recommend Imagify, which is made by the same talented people behind WP rocket. This also implied that Imagify perfectly compliments WP Rocket. Imagify will automatically reduce the image\u2019s file size and even convert the uploaded image into WebP. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an agency, these features are beneficial for us since we can rest assured that the files are always in the appropriate sizes once we hand them down to any of our clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER Six<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Wrap-Up<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning how to speed up WordPress websites brings plenty of benefits to your company.
