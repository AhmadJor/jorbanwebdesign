So in this post, we\u2019ll talk about 12 of the worst website redesign mistakes you should avoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get right to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter1\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER ONE<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Why You Need to Avoid Website Redesign Mistakes<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t do your best to avoid making redesign mistakes, you\u2019ll have to deal with regrettable risks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website ranking will go down, fewer and fewer people will see your website when they make queries on search engines<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You will lose leads &#8211; your potential clients<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your marketing efforts will go to waste<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your brand can get discredited in the industry<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You\u2019ll be giving undue advantage to your competitors<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your business can close down<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Redesigning a website is not as easy as hiring a web designer and telling him how you\u2019d want the website to look. It involves more than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses made mistakes that cost them. But you can avoid them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the biggest website redesign mistakes you dodge altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The 12 Worst Redesign Mistakes &#8211; Avoid At All Costs<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-checking-previous-analytics-current-web-design-and-feedbacks\">Not Checking Previous Analytics, Current Web Design, And Feedbacks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying on gut feeling or peer opinions alone is a formula for a website redesign disaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you might already have a new design for your website in mind, checking your previous analytics on your current design will help you answer the question of why you need to revamp your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with analysis and feedback will ensure your redesign efforts will go in the right direction, your budget won\u2019t go to waste, and your income goals are met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a list of the outdated features of your website, another list of functional technologies, and elements that are not on your website yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need to take on a more <a href=\"https:\/\/novumhq.com\/cheapest-website-builder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">functional website builder <\/a>than the one your first used and <a href=\"https:\/\/novumhq.com\/contact-management-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">migrate your data<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also check which pages have the least visits, how many pages a unique visitor visits and what path he takes, the bounce rates for each page, and other important KPIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven\u2019t utilized Google Analytics yet, now is the best time to do it. This free analytics tool will help you know your website&#8217;s weak and strong points and help you track visitor behavior when on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" class=\"wp-image-30263\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have measurable data in place, it\u2019s easier to see what needs to be changed and which pages to prioritize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you can also do is to use a heat map to check which parts of your web pages have the most engagements. This will help you to see what you just changed and what you should retain in your current design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, you should also consider feedback. When choosing a web designer to do the revamp, it\u2019ll be helpful to tap a couple of them and ask for an initial analysis of the website and what they plan to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way you get expert feedback and you\u2019ll also get to choose the best person to do the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-testing-enough\">Not Testing Enough<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than checking for analytics, before you can do the actual website redesign, it will be helpful to do the following testing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Functionality<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Testing third-party integrations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Setting up 301 redirects<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cross-browser testing in the computer, tablet, and mobile phone<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Checking for on-page SEO<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grammar and spelling check<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Load speed check<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for these will help you see what already works well so you can continue implementing it on the revamp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the testing doesn\u2019t stop there. The same test still has to be done right before and after the launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This extensive testing process will ensure lapses will be taken care off so no blunders will arise and is bug-free once the website is fully operational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you\u2019ll be avoiding the risk of applying the same outdated logic and structure from your previous design. Many testers this has been a common blunder for revamping websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-setting-scalable-goals\">Not Setting Scalable Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After gathering analytics insights and doing some testing, now you have the data needed to see why your website needs a redesign by identifying loopholes and what you should change in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have the data, you\u2019ll clearly see what problems you\u2019ll be solving, challenges that need to be addressed, resources you\u2019ll be needing, and what comprises a successful website redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re an eCommerce site like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3wishes.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mannequin Mall<\/a> and 3Wishes (a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3wishes.com\" rel=\"noopener\">costume<\/a> store), a problem you can see during analysis and testing is a huge drop from the add-to-cart page to the purchase page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing this, you can then set a goal to see fewer abandoned carts and more conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you have a review website like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalalertbuyersguide.org\/best-medical-alert-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medical Alert Buyers Guide<\/a>, you found out from analysis that website visitors have a huge problem with navigation. You then set a goal of making the navigation easier by reducing the visual clutter on each page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" class=\"wp-image-30264\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting goals will set the right perspective for your redesign project. This way, you can also easily determine if the redesign project was a success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, you\u2019ll have a hard time handling manpower, redesign budget, and also choosing vital integrations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a goal in mind, it\u2019ll be easy for you to change plans at the very last hour, wasting resources and time spent working on the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-prioritizing-aesthetics-over-functionality\">Prioritizing Aesthetics Over Functionality<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A website redesign isn\u2019t done just to make your website look better to make it more appealing. There\u2019s no point being appealing if visitors get a bad user experience and bounce right off the site never to return again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t generate sales and get the ROI for your redesign investment this way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functionality should be the utmost priority, visual appeal only second to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that the revamped website doesn\u2019t just look good, more importantly, it has to work better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigation should be easy and unnecessary pages should be removed or merged into another page as supplementary content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, you\u2019ll be hurting your <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website\u2019s conversion rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-indecisive-on-what-technology-or-integrations-to-use\">Indecisive On What Technology Or Integrations To Use<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does your website need? Are you a SaaS business for Amazon sellers like Aura that needs to offer exceptional customer support? You will need a live chat feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you offer an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gilisports.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">innovative product for a classic hobby like Gili Sports<\/a> does? You\u2019ll need to integrate a review page to prove your product\u2019s quality and credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you own a personalized product website like <a href=\"https:\/\/mixam.com\/booklets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mixam<\/a>? You\u2019ll need integrations that\u2019ll make it easy for customers to convey their references.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" class=\"wp-image-30265\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Know what integrations help lessen the friction to the conversion path. This way you won\u2019t be swayed to purchase technology that only seems like a fancy addition but has no significant contribution to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, doing extra research on the latest version of an integration will give you considerable time before needing another website redesign, in turn saving funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help, here\u2019s a free worksheet to know what you\u2019ll need for a website revamp. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-calculating-and-setting-an-overall-budget\">Not Calculating And Setting An Overall Budget<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201ccrossing the bridge when you get there\u201d attitude in this aspect of the website redesign process will only get you so far. Chances are, you\u2019ll be exhausting your funds to the last drop and still don\u2019t have a finished website revamp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it has been years since your website first went live, chances are the budget you set for it won\u2019t be enough for the revamp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web designers fees went up, more advanced features are needed, and some additional plugins need to be bought for added functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why in the previous point, it mentioned that you have to determine which technology and integrations to use because it\u2019s a big part of setting a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, setting a timeframe for the project will help set the budget. Without a timeframe, the website redesign process can take longer than expected which means exhausting more funds for the resources needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-making-the-web-design-complicated\">Making The Web Design Complicated<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When planning a website redesign, a balance must be set. Integrations are great for user experience, but going overboard can hurt the experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest trend in web design? Simplicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t mean making the pages look dull, just not having too much visual clutter that distracts the user from the parts where you need their attention most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the web design has too many elements going on, it can be too overwhelming and distracting. Visitors will likely hit the back button the second they see how the website looks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So avoid putting too much information on the front page, especially above the fold. You only have a second or so to convince visitors that your website is worth exploring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example of this is the current redesign made by <a href=\"https:\/\/everytale.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everytale, a video streaming platform<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg\" alt=\"Image 4\" class=\"wp-image-30266\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above-the-fold portion of the homepage is simple yet very captivating with its video and enticing copy. Everytale is a great example of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/saas-and-technology-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SaaS website design done right<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep them captivated by keeping things simple but enticing. If they don\u2019t see too much information the first time they set foot on the website, they\u2019ll be more motivated to scroll down and check what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make things easier on the eyes, categorize elements on the website, if you have tons of blogs, divide them into categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example to look at for this is Key West Aloe, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/beauty-and-cosmetic-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beauty online store<\/a>. Because of the number of products they have, they made it easier for visitors by categorizing it into 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-5.jpg\" alt=\"Image 5\" class=\"wp-image-30267\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have lots of contact information, you can either add dividers or make the spaces in between information big enough to make visual segments easily perceptible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unreasonably-rushing-the-project\">Unreasonably Rushing The Project<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is going to be your first website redesign, chances are you\u2019ll have to do a major overhaul of the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will take time to analyze the current design and get feedback, it will take time to plan and implement tests, it will take time to decide which integration should be added, and it will take time to put everything together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, drag and drop website builders are available but it definitely won\u2019t be an overnight project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about building a house, would you trust the structure enough to live and sleep peacefully in it if it just took a day to build it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality will always be in question in these cases, the same goes true for redesigning a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get a reasonable time frame, consult with a few designers. Tell them what the work involves and how much they think it will take. From their various responses, you can take the average duration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might help to divide the redesign into phases and set deadlines for each phase so it\u2019s easier to see the progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, you have to consult with the web designer so you can set workable deadlines that won\u2019t compromise the output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-neglecting-seo\">Neglecting SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a website that doesn\u2019t rank well on search engines is like building a store in the middle of nowhere &#8211; you won\u2019t get customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report by the Search Engine Journal, around 60-70% of companies lose organic traffic after a website redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, neglecting search engine optimization is one of the biggest mistakes when doing a website redesign. No matter how good your website looks, if people don\u2019t see it in search engines, you\u2019ll be the only one appreciating it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, you should always stay on top of the SEO trends. If you\u2019re hands-on with the project, you can take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reliablesoft.net\/seo-certifications-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO training<\/a> to have better control of your website visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work involves:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Submitting a sitemap to major search engines for your redesigned website to be crawled, indexed, and ranked for any related query<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensuring old website URLs are redirected to the new ones through 301 redirects. It\u2019s best if you keep the old URLs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security is also a search engine ranking factor, make sure to install security measures, an SSL certificate at the least to ensure browsing safety for visitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel that you\u2019re spreading yourself too thin by taking on the responsibility of working on the SEO, you can always hire an SEO agency to do the job for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is vital for your landing page, product page, and other content like your blogs. This is why this strategy is something you shouldn\u2019t neglect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overlooking-making-a-proper-content-strategy\">Overlooking Making A Proper Content Strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A redesigned website is only as good as the content it has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh content containing keywords with high search volume will drive the very people who you redesigned the website for to your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at how that looks with this blog on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timecamp.com\/blog\/2021\/06\/best-apps-for-timesheets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best timesheet apps<\/a> made by TimeCamp.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before you start planning a website redesign, strong and fresh content must already be entrenched on your website so you have an initial list of leads to improve for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without them, you won\u2019t have an initial set of testers to check if your revamped website is functional enough to drive more leads and conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-optimizing-for-lead-generation\">Not Optimizing For Lead Generation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving visitors to your website will be of little use if you can\u2019t convert them to leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website has to act as a catch basin for people you can potentially sell your items to. You can only move them further in the buyer\u2019s journey if you have lead generation mechanisms in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, you have to show your brand\u2019s credibility. With that initial trust barrier broken through, you&#8217;ll have more chances of converting casual visitors to buying customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you create a strong content strategy but don\u2019t complement it with lead generation tools, you\u2019re like releasing an arrow but not aiming at the target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can you aim your arrows at the target? Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Define your target audience<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create short educational articles that\u2019ll be helpful for that target audience to position yourself as a thought leader in the industry<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a lead magnet to collect the name, email address, and phone numbers of website visitors, when they realize you\u2019re a credible source, they\u2019ll want to learn more from you<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create an email marketing sequence that\u2019ll build up your credibility further and answer questions regarding your product that stops them from converting<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schedule calls on those who provided their phone number so you directly ask them for their concerns, assist them, or motivate them further to finally convert. Having a <a href=\"https:\/\/close.com\/crm\/predictive-dialer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predictive dialer<\/a> will make things easier for you, it\u2019s another integration you can consider<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once they convert, continue to nurture leads by providing valuable content for recurring revenue<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways of offering a lead magnet, some insert it in a blog post while others are more direct by offering it on the homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what GrowthRocks, a <a href=\"https:\/\/growthrocks.com\/blog\/growth-hacking-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth hacking<\/a> service did, and it\u2019s an effective strategy because unlike most that offer PDF guides, they offer a free website health check in exchange for your email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-6.jpg\" alt=\"Image 6\" class=\"wp-image-30268\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But some people prefer getting direct answers from your team. So create a \u201cContact Us\u201d page so they can get in touch with you in their preferred channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a live chat feature will also be helpful so leads get the information they need instantly. <a href=\"https:\/\/winpure.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Winpure<\/a> does this outstandingly, with their live chat feature, they assure a reply within a few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-7.jpg\" alt=\"Image 7\" class=\"wp-image-30269\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, don\u2019t forget to add call-to-action buttons on your landing page, contact page, and blog pages. This is a clear way of telling visitors what action you want them to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-designing-a-functional-responsive-and-mobile-optimized-website\">Not Designing A Functional, Responsive, And Mobile-Optimized Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A functional website seamlessly works between different browsers and different operating systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t guarantee that a network of people use the same browser and operating system. If one of them recommends your brand to another and your website doesn\u2019t work with the gadget they are using, you\u2019ll be losing potential customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can quickly be fixed by cross-browser testing so that bugs can be removed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is responsiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes clicking on one button but opening another. Always check if the website is responsive to the commands you give it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsiveness also involves fast load speeds. Ensure that the elements you include on your website, specially images and videos are not too heavy. But also ensure that you choose file sizes that don\u2019t compromise the image and video quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/what-users-want-most-from-mobile-sites-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> notes that 75% of internet users choose a mobile-friendly site.
