During a website redesign, you may also change the aesthetic aspects of your site like the media and color palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the site owner, you want to redesign your website for one purpose: to attract and retain your audience or clients. A better user interface or experience is the goal of a site redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A site with improved design will have considered data and current best practices. As a result, the product of site redesign is a site that delivers a superior page experience, fast loading times, low bounce rates, and an all-around amazing experience for you buyer persona.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-page-experience-update-begins-rolling-out\/410660\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">page experience carries over to better online visibility and traffic.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do companies redesign their websites?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, your corporate website is like a pair of shoes. You need them. They can be worthwhile investments-at least, until you outgrow them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business evolves and scales, changes occur. Your brand persona changes, and, so does your customer base. When shifts in your clientele and business goals occur, your website needs to follow suit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for this reason that you may need to redesign website design in key areas. The <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website services we offer<\/a>, including our <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web development services<\/a>, allow your website to evolve with the times and your changing goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is a Site Redesign Important?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to give your website a make-over for several reasons. The first reason is to improve the user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the needs and desires of your clients change, their navigation habits and their tastes can follow suit. Hence, changing your site&#8217;s features to appeal to your clients&#8217; needs and tastes will contribute to more traffic and conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason is to create an image of authority. Site visitors are usually quick to judge based on appearances. It is no coincidence that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webfx.com\/blog\/web-design\/website-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credibility and better site design are co-terminus with each other.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting Started<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so now that we&#8217;ve got that out of the way, do you still feel like you&#8217;re at the point where a website redesign is the next right step for your business? If so, read on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter1\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER 1<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The 7 Essential Elements of an Effective Web Design<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance is at the heart of every website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every effective website design contains 7 elements.

Who is your business for? What products and services do you offer? What&#8217;s the benefit\/result you get people? Your messaging should answer those questions at a glance for your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your target customer should be able to land on your home page and immediately know what you do and whether they are or aren&#8217;t the perfect fit for your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: your new site is supposed to convert website visitors into customers. Your messaging can make or break that goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;this means you should invest in a digital marketer or copywriter to help you nail your messaging. This is one of the most important changes you&#8217;ll make during your website redesign.

If it costs $2 to get 1 person in your funnel&#8230;that&#8217;s a $30 profit for every $20 you spend. We&#8217;d do that all day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can (and should) automate your entire funnel. Once someone finds you from your website content or your ads, you don&#8217;t need to make any more manual actions.

Goals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThe goals you have for your business will determine what you need to change in your site. Anybody can pick and choose which page to change; effective website redesign starts during goal-setting.<br>\nDuring goal-setting, it is important to have goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. This is where data comes in.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data in the form of key performance indicators give you a measurable yardstick for your efforts. By setting certain targets you can measure numerically, you can have a better idea of how to redesign your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let us imagine that you want more leads for your business. This is not a bad goal to have, but it can be tough to measure. After all, your website can have thousands of visitors a day, and not one will signify further interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2615875?hl=en#:~:text=Clickthrough%20rate%20(CTR)%20can%20be,your%20CTR%20would%20be%205%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rates<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/10\/dwell-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dwell times<\/a>, you can design your site in a way that encourages navigation.

A website can convey your brand persona or identity to visitors. A brand persona can be understood as personality traits you wish to convey to your visitors. It is based on how you want your audience to see your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The traits you wish to convey can be represented by changes to your site&#8217;s aesthetic and functional features. For example, you would not use red for a color palette if you were marketing sleep aids. Nor would you position online forms away from your landing page if you are selling an emergency service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER 4<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How to Budget for a Website Redesign<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing you want is to get slapped in the face with a price tag that&#8217;s way above what you imagined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why you take stock of your resources so you can direct your spending where it counts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this chapter, you&#8217;ll learn what a website makeover costs and put together a realistic budget for your website redesign project plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But different websites and industries have different needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might need to calculate your budget differently than someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re an ecommerce venture, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-redesign\/#ebf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jump to the ecommerce budget formula section of this chapter<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, keep reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pricing for B2B Websites<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all for web design pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We prefer to price website redesigns by the value of an improved web presence instead of at standard tiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because some companies and industries value a strong web presence more than others.

It&#8217;s important to find someone who feels like a fit in terms of personality, expertise, and humility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Personality<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll work with this vendor for a long time. It&#8217;s important that you like them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal partner will understand and emulate your values. Many agencies list their values on their website; double check that they align with yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to pay attention to how they treat you-do they show up late? How do they respond to your questions and concerns? Trust your intuition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of web design agencies. If someone gives you a weird vibe, back away and look for someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Expertise<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Plenty of agencies with impressive portfolios might not be the best fit for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ideal partner should have some success (re)designing websites in your field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One company might build an awesome travel agency website but lack the acumen to build a stellar ecommerce website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another might not have the A-list clientele you&#8217;d like to see but their ecommerce work might speak for itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to evaluate each potential partner on their own merits and not in competition with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Humility<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Be adamant about getting the best possible product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best agencies to partner with will be humble. They understand that, as the client, your needs come first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beware the agency whose ego conflicts with your business interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a vendor immediately talks about their technical prowess or accolades instead of asking you questions about your goals, challenges, or overall strategy, run away. Far away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not the agency you want to manage your website redesign process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Need some more help figuring out what you want in a dream partner?
