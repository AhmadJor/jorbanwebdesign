There can be thousands of reasons to explain this mishap, from compromised code to broken plugins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this, the best solution is to determine the root cause of the error. Things you can do to try and eliminate the problem are to check your .htaccess file, switch your WordPress theme to the default, or increase your memory limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your connection issue could also stem from corrupt plugins, in which case you will have to deactivate plugins instead of concentrating on the error message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the best practice for WordPress bug fixing is to treat the symptoms and not the overall cold!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Images Not Loading<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you experienced images suddenly disappearing from your website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might just be happily tapping away code for new sections of your blog when, suddenly, your pictures are gone, vanished, nowhere to be seen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially a pressing issue for <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress eCommerce<\/a> enthusiasts who make their living selling products using visuals!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the website admin directly adds an image to the media uploader, an error pops up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, all files in the media library appear broken. This problem can be caused by incorrect directory and file permissions when WordPress is installed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s important to note is that these images aren\u2019t completely gone \u2014 WordPress at least adds a temporary image placeholder of sorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors contribute to this pesky issue. First, something may have been misconfigured on your shared hosting server, which changed important file permissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, your web hosting provider implementing updates can unexpectedly change file permissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To carry out WordPress bug fixing and apply the correct file permissions, you must use an FTP client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect to your site through FTP, and find the <em>uploads<\/em> folder in the <em>\/wp-content\/<\/em> folder, where WordPress keeps track of all your uploads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, right-click the directory and select File Permissions. You must set the numerical value of file permissions for the uploads directory to 744. Check the box for <em>Recurse into subdirectories<\/em> and select <em>Apply to directories only<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After clicking OK, your client will begin changing the file permissions of the directories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you need to set file permissions for the <em>files<\/em> in the uploads directory. This time, change the value in the box to 644.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still need to check <em>Recurse into subdirectories<\/em>, but for this step, you must select the other radio button that says <em>Apply to files only<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After confirming the changes, your FTP client will adjust permissions for all files inside the folder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voila, the issue is fixed! You can try uploading images back in your WordPress admin area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The White Screen of Death (WSOD)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1025\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD.jpg\" alt=\"Unavailable Due to Maintenance\" class=\"wp-image-35028\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/The-White-Screen-of-Death-WSOD-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Unavailable Due to Maintenance<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t let the name spook you for too long! The White Screen of Death, or the WSOD, is analogous to the Blue Screen of Death Windows users may have encountered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a plain white screen with no error message when you attempt to run your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s actually pretty easy to troubleshoot the underlying factors behind a WSOD. It could be caused by malfunctioning plugins, new themes, or other add-on features causing the site to load just a pesky blank page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix it, try going through all your installed plugins, themes, and add-ons to determine whether you can remove any unnecessary ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some of these WordPress accessories may be important for your website\u2019s functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, check for updates and make sure you have the latest version of all your plugins, themes, and add-ons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outdated ones can cause compatibility issues with your server\u2019s configuration, so consistently updating your website\u2019s features is a helpful way to avoid WSODs from happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34922\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square.jpg 500w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Caleb-square-48x48.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Fixing bugs on WordPress sites is not overly complicated.

A temporary <em>.maintenance<\/em> file, which enables maintenance mode and is usually deleted after successful updates, remains on your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, your website will be set to lockdown mode, making it unavailable for both admins and visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there\u2019s no need to worry. Fixing this issue can be done with just a few mouse clicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like with image upload issues, you will have to access your site\u2019s root folder using an FTP client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin this method of WordPress bug fixing, find your website\u2019s <em>.maintenance<\/em> file in your WordPress root directory. If you\u2019re unable to see it, make sure your system is set to show hidden files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For platforms like Filezilla, you can enable this option by clicking on Server, then selecting <em>Force showing hidden files<\/em> on the menu toolbar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve found the <em>.maintenance<\/em> file, delete it from your system. Your site will disable maintenance mode, and your website should be accessible again to users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users unfamiliar with FTP, you can also delete the .maintenance file using the file manager in your hosting control panel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent this issue from reappearing in the future, you should optimize WordPress performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ways to do this include upgrading to a higher hosting plan with superior capabilities or patiently doing plugin and theme updates one by one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Wrap-Up<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an excellent platform \u2014 each day, unique functionalities are added through plugins and add-ons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the implementation of these new features isn\u2019t always perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oftentimes, when they\u2019re incompatible with the system framework, bugs and error messages can ensue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although web designers and web developers often encounter these issues, fixing them is a walk in the park once you understand the underlying factors that cause the problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it\u2019s definitely important to be aware of processes in WordPress bug fixing to ensure your audience is satisfied and happy with the overall quality of your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information and help with updating your WordPress website, make sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contact us<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WordPress bug fixing is important to the overall health of your website.
