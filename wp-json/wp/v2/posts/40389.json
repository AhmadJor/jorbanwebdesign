Choosing the right platform is crucial for smooth operations and profitability. WordPress is a popular option for online stores, with many eCommerce plugins to choose from, but deciding on the right plugin can feel like a daunting task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list compares five popular WordPress eCommerce plugins of 2023, including their features, advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we assess other factors such as customization options and customer support to aid in your decision-making process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-considerations-when-selecting-a-wordpress-ecommerce-plugin\">Considerations when selecting a WordPress eCommerce Plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When selecting a WordPress eCommerce plugin for your website, it is crucial to take into account the type of products you will be offering and the features you require. If your intention is to sell digital products, such as music, eBooks, and photos, it would be beneficial to search for a plugin specifically designed for this type of commerce platform. These applications will enhance your protection against pirated content and provide a more streamlined user experience for potential customers browsing your online marketplace. If you plan to sell physical goods that require shipping, you should select an eCommerce software that is specifically designed for it. If you operate a drop-shipping business, you may require real-time inventory support, securely integrated payment platforms, and scalability features to handle surges in demand or traffic during special occasions. It is crucial to ensure that the chosen WordPress eCommerce solution includes all the necessary tools and additional add-ons for efficient online operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-requirements-for-operating-an-ecommerce-website\">What are the requirements for operating an eCommerce website?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right hosting provider is important for a successful eCommerce website. Your hosting plan must be able to handle the resource demands of an online shop while fulfilling all of your other needs. Some stand-out affordable options are SiteGround and Bluehost; with SSL certificates, dedicated IPs, and support lines, they help tight budgets make sales. For those with more resources, WPEngine, a managed WordPress hosting provider, offers better performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After selecting your website host, it&#8217;s time to buy your domain name. This will be the URL used by customers to access your site, so make it memorable and catchy. With these requirements met, you&#8217;re one step closer to launching your own eCommerce website. Congrats!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-five-recommended-ecommerce-plugins-for-wordpress\">Five Recommended eCommerce Plugins for WordPress<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking the right eCommerce platform for your WordPress site can be tough. Luckily, there are plenty of eCommerce plugins to help. They come in a range of options, from pre-built and easy-to-use to customizable and advanced. These choices fit varying budgets and needs, so keep your use case in mind. This article will explain some of these options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/easy-digital-downloads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Easy Digital Downloads<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/members\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MemberPress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bigcommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BigCommerce<\/a> for Wordpress<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-shopify\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive into each!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-woocommerce\">1. WooCommerce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce<\/a> is the top open-source eCommerce platform for online stores. It&#8217;s a popular WordPress plugin that offers great customization options. Developers prefer it and it&#8217;s now available for specialized hosting solutions, providing better performance and reliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Automattic acquired WooCommerce, a service for hosting blogs, greatly improving the platform&#8217;s user experience and technology. As a result, the customer base has grown and third-party developers have created many extensions for WooCommerce stores. This, along with a passionate community of supporters, has made WooCommerce a leading eCommerce solution for small business owners and web designers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-woocommerce\">Benefits of WooCommerce<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, WooCommerce is a great WordPress eCommerce plugin. It has many extensions and themes available, so you can easily add features and customize your design to reflect your brand or message. With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital products like ebooks, music, and software. It&#8217;s a simple way to create an online store with just one plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, WooCommerce simplifies inventory management by tracking stock levels and assigning a store manager. It also offers great functionality for external or affiliate products, making it easy to include them on your website. This eCommerce plugin has all the features you need to start selling online without any extra plugins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cons-of-using-woocommerce\">Cons of Using WooCommerce<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce has many options, which can be overwhelming for new users. It takes time to learn how everything works and find suitable add-ons, and some themes work better with the plugin than others. To use WooCommerce fully, you need a theme made for your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-easy-digital-downloads\">2. Easy Digital Downloads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/easy-digital-downloads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)<\/a> is a user-friendly platform for selling digital products on WordPress. It has simple features and lets you create a highly customized store for your needs. Not only is EDD easy to configure and use but with its continued growth there are now various hosting options out there which have EDD pre-installed so that setting up a store from scratch can be done in no time. Whether you\u2019re selling software, music files, or courses, EDD makes the process much faster by automating the checkout process and other parts of your website\u2019s workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pros-of-using-easy-digital-downloads\">Pros of Using Easy Digital Downloads<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy To Use<\/strong> \u2013 EDD is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to set up a store regardless of their experience with WordPress. This makes it much easier to find the features you need and make sure they are all focused on selling your specific types of products.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrations<\/strong> \u2013 EDD also has a lot of great integrations with third-party services such as PayPal and Stripe, making it simple to accept payments on your website. Additionally, EDD integrates with some popular WordPress plugins such as Gravity Forms and WPForms for added functionality.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multiple Payment Options<\/strong> \u2013 EDD offers a range of payment options, which makes it easier for customers to purchase your products. This includes payments through PayPal, credit cards, and even cryptocurrency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extensive Reporting<\/strong> \u2013 EDD also offers extensive reporting options so you can keep an eye on your store\u2019s performance. This will help you make sure that everything is running smoothly and that your store is making money.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extensions<\/strong> \u2013 There are a range of extensions available which you can use to add additional features to your store. This includes things such as discounts and coupons, customer management tools, and email marketing integrations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Software Licensing<\/strong> \u2013 EDD also offers software licensing so you can sell products which need to be activated after purchase. This is particularly useful for those who are selling software, as it adds an extra layer of security.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Themes<\/strong> \u2013 EDD also has a range of compatible themes available so you can easily customize the look and feel of your store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cons-of-using-easy-digital-downloads\">Cons of Using Easy Digital Downloads<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Physical Goods<\/strong> \u2013 Unfortunately, EDD does not support the sale of physical goods, so if you want to sell anything other than digital items you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Shipping Options<\/strong> \u2013 Since EDD is focused on digital products, it doesn\u2019t come with any shipping or delivery options built-in. If you want to offer the ability for customers to collect their purchased items in person then this isn\u2019t an option with EDD.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fewer Add-ons<\/strong> \u2013 EDD has fewer add-ons than WooCommerce does, so it might not be able to offer the same level of customization and features that WooCommerce can.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Support<\/strong> \u2013 Although the documentation for EDD is very comprehensive, the support provided by the developers is limited. This means that if you run into any issues while setting up your store or managing it in the long run, you may not be able to get help right away.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-memberpress\">3. MemberPress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/memberpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MemberPress<\/a> is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to help users create and manage subscription services and digital products. With its easy-to-use membership plugin, you can limit access to your content, create coupons and discount codes, handle payment processing, set up recurring payments, and more. It also allows for integration with many other platforms such as WooCommerce. While you might be tempted to jump head first into building your product or service on MemberPress, there are pros and cons that should be considered first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pros-of-using-memberpress\">Pros of Using MemberPress<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy To Use<\/strong> \u2013 Setting up and managing a store with MemberPress is incredibly easy. The user interface is simple and intuitive, meaning that even those without any technical knowledge should be able to get up and running in no time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integration With Other Services<\/strong> \u2013 MemberPress also integrates with many other platforms such as WooCommerce and MailChimp which makes it easier to manage your store and keep in touch with customers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Powerful Access Rules<\/strong> \u2013 With MemberPress you can easily limit access to your content, giving you full control over who has access and when. This is particularly useful for those selling subscription-based products or services.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Built-in Course Builder<\/strong> \u2013 MemberPress also comes with a built-in course builder so you can easily create online courses for your customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cons-of-using-memberpress\">Cons of Using MemberPress<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited Payment Options<\/strong> \u2013 Unfortunately, MemberPress does not offer support for all payment gateways. This means that if you want to use a payment gateway other than Stripe, PayPal, and Authorize.net, then you may have to look elsewhere.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Physical Product Support <\/strong>\u2013 As with EDD, MemberPress does not support the sale of physical goods. If you\u2019re looking to sell anything other than digital items then you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Physical Product Support<\/strong> \u2013 MemberPress does not support the sale of physical products, so if you want to sell anything other than digital items then you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Shopping Cart Feature<\/strong> \u2013 Unlike WooCommerce, MemberPress does not have the ability to add multiple items to a cart before the checkout process starts. Instead, customers will need to purchase each item individually which can lead to more abandoned purchases due to people getting distracted or frustrated.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More Expensive<\/strong> \u2013 Although MemberPress does offer a lot of powerful features, it is more expensive than some other WordPress eCommerce plugins. This could be a dealbreaker for those on a tight budget.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Not Open Source<\/strong> \u2013 Unlike WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads, MemberPress is not an open-source plugin which means that customizing the code to suit your needs could prove difficult.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Yearly Pricing<\/strong> \u2013 One of the biggest drawbacks to MemberPress is that the pricing model is based on yearly subscription. This means that if you want to use the service for a longer period of time, you may end up paying more than you\u2019d like.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-bigcommerce\">4.

This means you can keep more of your profits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cons-of-using-bigcommerce\">Cons of Using BigCommerce<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited Integrations<\/strong> \u2013 BigCommerce integrates with all the top third-party apps and tools. However, its app store is still growing, and you may not find an integration for some less popular apps.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Yearly Sales Threshold<\/strong> \u2013 Each plan has a sales threshold that must be met annually. Once the threshold is reached, the next plan will be activated. Watch out! As your business expands, so will the price tag.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pricing<\/strong> \u2013 BigCommerce is one of the more expensive WordPress eCommerce plugins available. Although it offers a lot of features, this may make it too expensive for some users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complex Setup<\/strong> \u2013 BigCommerce is a powerful platform and can be quite complex to set up. It may require professional help to ensure you get everything configured correctly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Not Open Source<\/strong> \u2013 As with many other eCommerce platforms, BigCommerce isn\u2019t open source which means customizing the code and adding features can be difficult.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-shopify\">5. Shopify<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-shopify\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shopify<\/a> is another popular eCommerce platform that provides an easy and efficient way to build an online store. It is a great choice for those who are looking for a comprehensive solution with lots of features, as well as those who need extra help in setting up their store. Shopify also has powerful built-in features such as inventory management, marketing automation and customer segmentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pros-of-using-shopify\">Pros of Using Shopify<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Super Easy for Beginners<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/shopify-online-store-2\/\">Shopify is incredibly user-friendly<\/a>&nbsp;and easy to use even if you\u2019ve never created an online store before.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Supports Both Digital and Physical Goods<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Whether you\u2019re selling physical goods like shirts or digital downloads like music, Shopify can handle it all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complete Inventory Management<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Shopify comes with an inventory editor and bulk importer combined with an order tracker which makes managing inventory a breeze.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Payment and Shipping Options<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Shopify offers payment and shipping options that simplify the process for accepting credit cards online and in person.
