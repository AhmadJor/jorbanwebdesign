And why should that matter to the people that visit your website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can leave the reader a lasting impression of your brand by providing them with information like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-story-to-share\">A Story To Share<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has a story to share, and your company is no different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody else is doing what your company is doing with the exact same motivations. The About Us section of your website is an excellent way to share this information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Differentiating yourself from the competition is as simple as telling your story, and there&#8217;s no better place to do so than on your About page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, your brand&#8217;s story will resonate more strongly with consumers if they can relate to its trials and tribulations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite how much you want to, don&#8217;t write a story longer than 2000 words. It&#8217;s highly improbable that a visitor will read the whole thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the contrary, you should be succinct, accurate, and to the point. Don&#8217;t brag too much about yourself or ramble on unrelated topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/deAnna-klein-news-page.png\" alt=\"deAnna klein news page\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The About Us page is a great place for corporations to speak to prospective customers in an authentic and personal way that builds a real emotional connection without corporate jargon or sales-minded language.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeAnna Klein, Copywriter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-forward-thinking-future\">Forward Thinking Future<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What will happen to your company in the future?

The human brain processes images considerably faster than it does text; thus, it was wise of Coca-Cola to include them on its About page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may not read everything on a page, but they can still get a sense of what the company does just by looking at the pictures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-dick-s-sporting-goods\">2.

The brand&#8217;s story is written in a way that grabs readers&#8217; attention and motivates them to act. It also flows nicely into the brand&#8217;s current mission statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods does a great job of giving first-time visitors the information they need to get to know the company without making them wade through the founder&#8217;s entire life story. You can apply this to your own business by learning <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/about-us-page-copywriting\/\">About Us page copywriting<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To pique the interest of site visitors, the About Us page includes a timeline detailing key moments in the organization&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all else, the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\/\">web design<\/a> is simple and straightforward, making it easy on the eyes without being overwhelming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-hitt\">3.

This helps build trust among visitors and encourages them to choose HITT as their general contractor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a timeline of significant events in the company&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page also includes a photo gallery showcasing life at HITT.

It places a heavy emphasis on the company&#8217;s backstory from its inception to the present day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the page highlights the company&#8217;s certifications, which should reassure site visitors that they are in good hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it is brief and to the point, it is quite effective. This demonstrates that About Us webpages do not need to be crammed with content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you can simply state who you are and what you do to get your point through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-mondelez-international\">5.
