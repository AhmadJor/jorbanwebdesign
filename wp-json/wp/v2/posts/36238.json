If you get 100 visitors, and out of those you get 4 purchases, your conversion rate is 4%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversion rate is a key metric for businesses to track, as it indicates how well they are doing at turning web traffic into paying customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of factors that can influence the conversion rate, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website design<\/a>, the quality of the product, and the price. Conversion rates can be improved by using A\/B tests for different versions of the website and by providing users with an incentive to convert, such as a discount or free shipping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking and improving the conversion rate, businesses can increase their sales and revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What is a Good Ecommerce Conversion Rate?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The ecommerce conversion rate benchmark across all ecommerce sectors in the United States is between 2.5% and 3%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/articles\/ecommerce\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to BigCommerce<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify, in the meantime, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/ecommerce-conversion-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reports<\/a> that \u201cthe average ecommerce conversion rate for Shopify stores is 1.4%.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One basic definition of a good ecommerce conversion rate would be one that is higher than the average conversion rate for ecommerce businesses\u2013or higher than 3%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To really understand what is a good ecommerce conversion rate for your industry, you\u2019ll need to benchmark your industry\u2019s average\u2014not just the aggregated average of all industries combined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ecommerce Conversion Rates by Industry<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce conversion rate benchmarks vary for different industries, so if you want to compare your own <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/ecommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ecommerce website<\/a>\u2019s conversion rate with someone else&#8217;s, here are conversion rate benchmarks from different industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Food and drink: 0.90% &#8211; 1.00%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baby and child: 0.71% &#8211; 0.87%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fashion, clothing, and accessories: 1.01% &#8211; 1.41%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kitchen and home appliances: 1.61% &#8211; 1.72%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Health and wellbeing: 1.87% &#8211; 2.02%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sports and recreation: 1.18%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Electrical and commercial equipment: 2.49% &#8211; 2.70%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is The Ecommerce Conversion Rate Formula?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ecommerce conversion rate formula is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversions \u00f7 visitors * 100 = conversion rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, your conversion rate is the number of conversions (usually sales) on your website, divided by the total number of visitors, times 100.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate the ecommerce conversion rate, you first need to track how many people visit your website and then track how many of those visitors make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use various tools to track this information, such as Google Analytics or Kissmetrics. Once you have this data, you can calculate your ecommerce conversion rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get a more accurate picture of your ecommerce conversion rate, you can also include average add-to-basket rates. This will tell you what percentage of visitors add items to their cart, and can be a useful metric for understanding the customer journey, and find out where people are dropping off in your conversion funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, including cart and abandoned cart rates can give you further insight into why people aren&#8217;t completing their purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Desktop vs Mobile Ecommerce Conversion Rate<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world becomes increasingly digitized, businesses are feeling pressure to optimize their online shops for both desktop and mobile shopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desktop experience is still important for many users, especially when it comes to making purchasing decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mobile shopper, on the other hand, is constantly on the go and may not have the time or patience to navigate complicated websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you optimize for desktop over mobile, or vice versa?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at these graphs below which highlight average ecommerce conversion rates by device:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you build or manage ecommerce stores, <a href=\"http:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/press\/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you\u2019re probably aware that mobile use is increasing at a very rapid rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, data based on more than 1.9 billion shopping sessions collected by Monetate, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/ecommerce\/ecommerce-analytics\/ecommerce-conversion-rates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clearly shows that \u2018traditional\u2019 (aka desktop) web users have decreased in terms of conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that brings up the question: How do we increase mobile conversion rates for smartphone users?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER Four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Why Desktops Still Dominate Conversion Rates<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36036\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img.png 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img-300x234.png 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img-768x600.png 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img-24x19.png 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img-36x28.png 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/gleamin-article-img-48x38.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span style=\"color: #808080;

They are now accustomed to buying everything from clothes to groceries online. However, a big percentage of them are used to the standard layout of a desktop website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth of the matter is, that we\u2019ve had more shopping experience working with the desktop computing platform because it\u2019s been around longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological triggers that entice customers to buy are more pronounced on the desktop. It\u2019s easier to include \u201cfear of missing out\u201d (FOMO) and other psychological marketing tactics when shoppers are using a larger screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, web experiences have effectively been standardized on the traditional platform. Consumers know what to expect. They know where to go. They understand how to operate a desktop website with little learning required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Traditional Platforms On Average, Have Better Connectivity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, wifi\/ethernet is a much more stable environment to shop on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not saying that this type of customer experience is exclusive to desktop and laptop computers, but it\u2019s almost always a given when using these devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been proven, <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/glinden\/Home\/StanfordDataMining.2006-11-28.ppt?attredirects=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">through a number of studies<\/a>, that quicker load times <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increase conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until wireless internet connections stabilize further, traditional devices will always inherently have an edge over mobile phones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bigger Screens = More Opportunity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, space is a huge advantage. UI designers can get away with a lot more on a desktop device simply due to the fact that the canvas to work with is larger. Bigger images, more menus, more product pages and onpage product recommendations can be seen as an enhancement to the online shoppers\u2019 experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Barriers And Hurdles For Smartphones<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the constant advancement of technology, many of these things are limitations of the smartphones that have to be worked around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Computing power on mobile devices is not as strong as on traditional platforms<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wireless connectivity for many is unreliable at best<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The platform limits how much space you have to work with<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Due to how rapidly devices and operating systems change, there is a much wider net to what defines a mobile user<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mobile users are typically experiencing more than one instance of media at any given time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not trying to knock smartphone manufacturers. They\u2019re developing products that have literally revolutionized how modern society works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, desktops offer better digital experiences to shoppers. There still seems to be a pretty big lack of mobile standardization and functionality which forces us, as ecommerce website developers, to discover effective workarounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36037\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683-24x16.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683-36x24.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-2b-min-1024x683-48x32.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>I<\/em><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\"><em style=\"color: rgb(128, 128, 128); font-size: 12pt;\">t&#8217;s easy to find yourself distracted by multiple devices, or, in a public setting like coffee shops.

Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What often goes overlooked is the number of requests a website must make in order to fully render the page. To explain it simply, each request requires the session to loop, drawing on the server and the ISP. Each loop takes time, and that time can add up quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This problem is often more difficult to fix, as all on-page assets such as images, video, scripts, and style sheets create these loops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy for ecommerce websites to get out of control with these types of assets, after all, your average online store usually requires many third-party tools to run smoothly (shipping, fulfillment, marketing, etc). It\u2019s also common that over time this issue becomes exaggerated as things get tacked onto the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Careful design and development planning can help combat these issues by prioritizing doing more with less from the get-go.

This often creates a passive mindset to purchasing, which naturally drives down average mobile conversion rate of online stores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since they\u2019re interested, but not necessarily ready to buy, we need to prioritize the creation of user experiences that allow customers&#8217; interest to peak, increase the clickthrough rate, and facilitate a longer buying process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Optimize How Your Products Are Displayed On Category Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most mobile websites default to a single-column view of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/category-page-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">category pages<\/a>. This optimizes the size of the product&#8217;s thumbnail photo but diminishes the ability to quickly browse through various products. For many online retailers, we\u2019ve found that displaying products in two columns rather than one actually increases the average session duration overall for our customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a product that can work as a smaller thumbnail, take advantage of the device&#8217;s screen space and reduce the size of the thumbnails to get more product recommendations in front of your customer per scroll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36040\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683-24x16.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683-36x24.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Bullet-3-min-1024x683-48x32.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #808080; line-height: 1.2em;\"><em>Different products require different displays.

It also has been proven to improve order accuracy. Tactile response is especially important when it comes to interacting with the checkout process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone adds something to their cart, they need an obvious visual cue to ensure that the product has been added successfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone completes form fields, there should be visual indicators that those fields are valid.

We try to answer them here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s a good conversion rate for ecommerce?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no one answer to the question of what&#8217;s a good conversion rate for ecommerce, as it can vary depending on factors such as the product being sold and the target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a general guideline is that a conversion rate of 2-3% is considered good, while a rate of 5% or more is considered excellent. Of course, these are just averages, and some businesses may convert at rates above or below these benchmarks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the best way to determine whether your conversion rate is good or not is to track it over time and compare it against your goals. If you&#8217;re seeing a consistent increase in conversion rates, then you&#8217;re on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a good conversion rate for mobile apps?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A conversion rate is the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to mobile apps, the average conversion rate is about 2-3%. Of course, conversion rates can vary depending on the type of app and the nature of the desired action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, apps that are designed to be used for a specific purchase (such as an airline ticket or a hotel room) will typically have higher conversion rates than general-purpose apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversion rates can be affected by factors such as the price of the product or service and the user&#8217;s level of interest in the app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, there is no &#8220;perfect&#8221; conversion rate for mobile apps; instead, it is important to track conversion rates over time and look for ways to improve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a mobile conversion rate?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mobile conversion rate is the percentage of mobile users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a mobile app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile conversion rates can be affected by a number of factors, including the design of the mobile website, the user experience, and the perceived value of the product or service being offered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to maximize the mobile conversion rate, businesses need to focus on creating a seamless user experience and ensuring that mobile users can easily find what they&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is a 30% conversion rate good?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a 30% conversion rate is very good for almost any industry for sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who sign up for a newsletter, then a 30% conversion rate would be considered less stunning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, a high conversion rate is indicative of a successful marketing campaign or product, while a low conversion rate can indicate that improvements are needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also worth noting that conversion rates can vary significantly depending on the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the average conversion rate for ecommerce websites is around 2-3%, while the average conversion rate for lead generation websites is around 10-15%. As such, it is important to compare the conversion rate to others in the same industry in order to get an accurate gauge of its success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whether or not a 30% conversion rate is good depends on the context in which it is measured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Further Reading On Website Design and Development.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for web development and design inspiration?
