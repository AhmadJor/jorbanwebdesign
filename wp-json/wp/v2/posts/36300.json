So try using colors and shapes that stand out from \u2014 but still complement \u2014 the rest of your page.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use persuasive language<\/strong>: Your CTA copy should be convincing and make users want to take the desired action. Be sure to avoid any vague or generic language and use powerful words to drive results.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offer something valuable<\/strong>: Give users a reason to click on your CTA by offering something they want or need, like a free e-book or an exclusive discount.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Test, test, test<\/strong>: Always test different versions of your CTAs to see what works best with your audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/media-exp2.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4E03AQEzirYnFEIipw\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200\/0\/1620339888208?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=V4Ul35FzsS_ilh9J1q95zYrnfPfqSBsly197okII7RU\" alt=\"Christi Carnahan\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>One of the most common mistakes we see are broad calls to action. &#8216;Learn More&#8217; buttons are often used generically on websites, leading to decreased CTRs and poor search engine result performance.

It tells visitors what they need to know and motivates them to take the next step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether clicking through to another page, making a purchase, or contacting your company, good copy makes the next step clear and accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to improve your website\u2019s performance, start by updating your document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headlines on your website or landing page are important because they tell visitors what they can expect to find on the rest of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your headlines could be more exciting, then people aren\u2019t going to want to read the rest of your content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid using powerful words and emotion-evoking language in your headlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make them curiosity-inducing by asking questions or promising results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, keep them short \u2014 ideally, no more than six words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/human-attention-span\/#:~:text=According%20to%20research%2C%20our%20attention,or%20object%20for%209%20seconds.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">People have short attention spans these days<\/a>, so you need to be able to grab their attention right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freshen up your copy with these additional tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use headlines and subheadings<\/strong>: They will break up your text and make it easier to scan. Nobody wants to read huge blocks of text, so use headlines and subheadings to break things up.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incorporate bulleted or numbered lists<\/strong>: This will increase readability, making your content more user-friendly and engaging.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Re-evaluate your headline<\/strong>: Is it attention-grabbing? Does it accurately reflect the content of your page? If not, it\u2019s time for an update.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Images Clickable<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just by making your images clickable, you can increase the number of people who click through to other pages on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an image looks like it should be leading website visitors to another page, make sure that it does indeed connect to the next page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the image is not clickable, users may become frustrated and leave your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the image leads them to the next page, they will likely stay on your site and continue browsing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like a small detail, but it can make a big difference in how many people click through to the next page on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you have an <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/ecommerce-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eCommerce website<\/a> and want people to click through to product pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to do this is by adding clickable images of those products next to your product descriptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way, people can easily click on the image and be taken directly to the product page without having to scroll down or search for it themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how will you make sure your clickable images get clicked? Here are a few ways to do that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use descriptive filenames<\/strong>: When uploading images to your website, use descriptive filenames that include relevant keywords.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimize your alt text<\/strong>: Besides using keywords in your filenames, include them in your alt text. This will help ensure that your images are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make your buttons stand out<\/strong>: Use a contrasting color or an attention-grabbing font to ensure they\u2019re easy to spot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use high-quality images<\/strong>: Finally, be sure to use high-quality images that are clear and free of distractions. Blurry or low-resolution photos will only serve to frustrate users and hurt your CTR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Improve Your Click Through Rates With Jorban<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing your CTR is vital for the success of your website.
