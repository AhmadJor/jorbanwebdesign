Still, with over 40% of websites using WordPress, it\u2019s also among the most targeted platforms for hackers and DDoS attacks. Here are the secrets to a secure <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/wordpress-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is WordPress Secure?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is among the most secure CMS platforms. That might not be obvious, considering how many articles you read about security attacks against WordPress websites. The truth is, when you power more than <a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/cm-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">40% of the world\u2019s websites<\/a>, you\u2019re bound to be a target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that exposure, WordPress has an impressive array of potential protections. However, the many moving parts that come together to create and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">design a website<\/a> can create security flaws when done incorrectly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, WordPress hosting can be secure. But how protected your website and backend data actually is depends on how actively you manage your security settings and the plan you have in place to prevent and mitigate attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably, some WordPress security vulnerabilities will pop up over time. In a world where <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/how-many-cyber-attacks-per-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">30,000 websites are hacked<\/a> every single day, that\u2019s almost inevitable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/woocommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce online store<\/a>, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-corporate-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B website<\/a> on WordPress, you\u2019ll need to understand potential flaws and put plans in place to protect your Wordpress website. That process is relatively simple\u2014as long as you know where to look and how to fix the most common issues. You\u2019ve lucked out; that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll cover in this guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter1\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 1<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 1: Login Security<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You, and anyone with access to edit your website\u2019s backend, have logins. How secure those logins will determine how successfully you can protect your site from vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is WordPress Easily Hacked?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety of your admin logins is perhaps the most straightforward security issue with WordPress. Because this CMS is so widely-used, the admin login screen (which is identical for all websites on the platform) is an easy target for malicious users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most commonly, your login security is compromised because of so-called brute force attacks. Here&#8217;s how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaspersky.com\/resource-center\/definitions\/brute-force-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cybersecurity firm Kaspersky describes <\/a>this old-but-proven hacking method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly. These attacks are done by &#8216;brute force&#8217; meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and &#8216;force&#8217; their way into your private account(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, hackers build a script that goes through millions of potential admin username and password combinations in the fraction of a second. Once they get lucky, the script notes the codes that got them there, providing easy access through the front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your login security isn&#8217;t always compromised through brute force, though. Easy-to-guess admin passwords (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.safetydetectives.com\/blog\/the-most-hacked-passwords-in-the-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here&#8217;s a list<\/a>) can allow access to anyone who&#8217;s willing to give it a shot. Once they&#8217;re in, they&#8217;ll be able to see and edit anything that you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I Improve My WordPress Security?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the solution to this security flaw is pretty simple: improve your passwords. Even sophisticated brute force attacks will have trouble guessing unpredictable passwords that are made of multiple character types. Strong passwords with combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters make it more difficult for hackers to break into your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/195430\/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide on creating a strong password<\/a> is a great resource to get started. Do it right, and it will take even a brute force algorithm years to crack it. And if all of that gets too complex for your own good, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/password-managers-a-little-pain-for-a-lot-better-security-world-password-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using password manager <\/a>can help you keep track and stay strong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take a few other steps, as well. <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/article\/two-step-authentication\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-step authentication<\/a> makes your admin passwords impossible to crack. You might also want to get rid of your standard \u201cadmin\u201d account, which tends to be first in line for an admin attack. With a two-step or two-factor authentication it helps to make sure that only authorized people are able to gain access to your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another suggestion is to limit those who have access to your website in the first place. This cuts down on the number of accounts that hackers can take over in order to gain access. Plus limiting the number of admin users helps to cut down on the amount of access and power admin user accounts have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For extra protection, give your WordPress login URL and information an update. Through the use of a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-limit-login-attempts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress security plugin<\/a>, you can limit login attempts and increase your WordPress security (just be careful of the plugins used as noted in our next section.) This ultimately can keep WordPress sites safer from hackers using brute force attacks to guess your password. Also limit login attempts for specific administrative roles\/positions within the website \u2013 the higher the role\/position the more security needed!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 2<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 2: Outdated Software or Plugins<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll often hear WordPress and cybersecurity experts lament the dangers of plugin. Let\u2019s not forget that plugins can be great in the right usage, but they do need to be managed to avoid security risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are Plugins?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress updates frequently. Generally speaking, we recommend checking for updates at least once every month. If you stop updating your core Wordpress software, you risk opening your site up to security flaws and security vulnerabilities that the updates are specifically designed to solve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is true for plugins, which are a convenient backdoor for hackers if the WordPress core software is well-protected. If you don\u2019t check for updates frequently, you could open yourself up for WordPress vulnerabilities and common WordPress website security issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignore these updates, and your website becomes vulnerable. Malicious users now have access to your backend code, which they can use to install WordPress malware or trackers that ultimately compromise your data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do You Fix WordPress Security Plugins?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easy answer is making sure that both your core WordPress software and your WordPress theme and plugins are always up to date. Here\u2019s how you can achieve that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within your WordPress system, navigate to the Updates tab, which gives you an easy overview of what needs to be updated, and what\u2019s already on the latest version of WordPress. You can also check for updates with the click of a button, and see the timestamp for the last time you performed that check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates for your Plugins will show up in the Plugins tab in the same system. You\u2019ll need to update<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress backup plugins and security plugins individually, which can take some time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check both tabs frequently. Once a month is a good cadence, but there are no penalties for more regular checks. Reserve some time to run the updates, especially if you\u2019ve recently <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">redesigned your website<\/a>, and make sure all installed software and plugins work with your current design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the best security plugins for WordPress?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though one security plugin can sufficiently protect your website, we suggest installing two or more security plugins for extra protection. The best security plugins for your WordPress site are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wordfence Security<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>iThemes Security<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Defender<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security Ninja<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sucuri<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>BulletProof Security<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jetpack<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 3<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 3: Malware<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard the term as a thing to avoid. But what is it, and how can you avoid it? Let&#8217;s dig into malware as a common WordPress security vulnerability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Malware?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Malware is short for \u201cmalicious software.\u201d It exists as a threat in anything related to coding and technology. In websites specifically, it\u2019s most commonly a few lines of codes that get smuggled into your website specifically to track and send out reports on sensitive data you\u2019d rather keep to yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malware can steal credit card information on your ecommerce site. It can check for customer logins or begin to follow your website users around to other destinations. It can even be used to spam your site\u2019s content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it\u2019s not necessarily the type of parasite you want to let in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do You Prevent Malware?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason malware finds its way onto WordPress websites are outdated plugins and themes, which can hinder the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-performance-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">speed of your WordPress site<\/a>. But we should also mention that some plugins come with malware built-in. Naturally, you want to avoid those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means you need to be judicious with any plugin that makes its way to your site. In its plugin directory, WordPress lists basic information about each of its 58,000+ options, including basic security measures. That\u2019s a great start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps to work with a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web development<\/a> partner who can vet plugins more thoroughly on your behalf. Generally speaking, it\u2019s better to pay a bit extra for a well-vetted plugin than get one for free that comes with an unhelpful, hidden malware addition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to be mindful in the beginning, though. It also helps to regularly run one of many available <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/website\/wordpress-security-scan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress security scans<\/a> that can help you with malware scanning, keep activity logs and alert you of suspicious activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 4<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 4: Phishing<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The name is somewhat self-explanatory, if you ignore the ph it starts with for a second. A phishing attack includes hackers literally fishing for personal information from your customers, using your website&#8217;s vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Phishing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how phishing tends to work: malicious users gaining access to your WordPress databases of website visitors through a vulnerability in your website\u2019s code. They use that contact information to send out countless emails pretending to be something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The message itself will contain a link promising a resolution or reward of some kind. Once the user clicks on it, malware installs on their computer or browser, and their information (including credit card information) is exposed to theft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve come across, or at least heard about this. Think Nigerian prince, social security scams, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/news\/pressrel\/press-releases\/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2020-internet-crime-report-including-covid-19-scam-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to the FBI<\/a>, phishing is the most common type of cyberattack today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most users won\u2019t fall for it. But if even one percent does, the phishers can claim success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the problem: when phishing happens through your website and\/or WordPress admin account, the attackers present themselves as representing you or your business. Users who fall for it will likely never trust you again. But even for those who recognize it as invalid, your credibility might be severely compromised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do I Protect My WordPress Admin Account from Phishing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because phishing relies on coding and malware within your system, the fix here is similar to some of the steps we\u2019ve mentioned above. Use secure usernames and passwords, regularly update your platform and plugins, and run periodic security checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also do more. For instance, consider using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/plugins\/how-to-add-recaptcha-to-wordpress-comment-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">technology like ReCAPTCHA<\/a> as another security solution, which can prevent bots from posting phishing messages in your comments. If you do get exposed to a phishing attack, a fast reaction to secure your WordPress website and let your users know not to click on specific links, can mitigate some damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 5<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 5: DoS Attacks<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, it&#8217;s somewhat like brute force. When hackers attack your website through a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, they try to overwhelm it with sheer volume. The results can be devastating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is DoS?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers engaging in a DoS attack send so much bot traffic to your website that your web servers can\u2019t handle it. The site crashes, preventing both you and your audience from accessing it until the problem is taken care of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the other security vulnerabilities mentioned so far, DoS attacks focus not on your website, but the server on which it sits. No server can handle an infinite amount of traffic, and the aim is to break it down so that the website has no foundation to stand on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, DoS attacks don\u2019t harm your website\u2019s code or sensitive data. They simply bring its infrastructure to its knees. Of course, you\u2019ll lose revenue and credibility in the process, especially since your users won\u2019t know what happened and simply think your website no longer exists until it\u2019s fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Protect a WordPress Website Against DoS and DDoS Attacks?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because DoS attacks aim at your website\u2019s server, finding the right hosting providers is key to preventing them. That server, ideally, should have some basic measures (such as a strong website firewall) in place to prevent simple attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the credibility and security of the hosting company itself, it also helps to plan with more bandwidth than you think you\u2019ll need. If your website can withstand an unexpected amount of traffic, you\u2019ll be prepared not just for an increase in customers over time but also the sudden increase that comes with simple attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even both of these steps may not completely secure you against DoS and DDoS attacks. That\u2019s why the final step is building a DoS or DDoS protection response plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn to spot early warning signs, such as spotty connectivity or random page load slowdowns. It also helps to have a backup plan in place to respond to an attack, which might include anything from notifications to your internal and external audiences, and the potential move to a new server should the DoS attack subsist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 6<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Vulnerability 6: SEO Spam<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let&#8217;s talk about the dark side of SEO. As much as we love optimizing websites to rank highly on search engines, the strategy can be exploited by malicious actors through SEO spam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is SEO Spam?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You know the typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/black-hat-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">black hat SEO strategies<\/a>, like link spamming and keyword stuffing? Google finds and punishes them pretty effectively these days. Of course, that&#8217;s not helpful if it&#8217;s being done specifically to hurt your website&#8217;s SEO efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO spammers do exactly that. They use malware to change code and content on your website to prompt Google to punish it. That might include filling the site with bad keywords, linking to and from low-credibility websites, and even creating pop-ups that worsen user experience and hide valuable content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can get worse. Advanced SEO spammers can use your hard-earned rankings to sell their own questionable merchandise. Once Google notices, your website (not theirs) will get the punishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, the results can be devastating. <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@SearchDecoder\/18-eye-opening-seo-statistics-to-prove-the-value-of-organic-search-ff1b19aade40#:~:text=51%25%20OF%20WEBSITE%20TRAFFIC%20COMES%20FROM%20ORGANIC%20SEARCH%20RESULTS&amp;text=According%20to%20a%20study%20conducted%20by%20BrightEdge%2C%20this%20means%20that,and%20paid%20search%20just%2010%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to one study<\/a>, 50% of organic traffic and 40% of revenue comes from organic search engine results. Imagine the devastation to your online pipeline if Google begins pushing your page down to lower rankings and pages in its results pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Do You Prevent SEO Spam?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO spammers largely operate through malware, so updated software and regular security checks can help here as well. That&#8217;s the basic start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, it also helps to closely monitor your search results and SEO efforts. If your strategy isn&#8217;t changing but you&#8217;re suddenly seeing decreases in search traffic, something is up that you might want to check out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, secure yourself against the most basic form of SEO spam: links to your site from questionable pages. Regularly <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/2648487?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disavowing bad backlinks<\/a> can help you keep that library clean and stay on the good side of Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there are a lot of things you can do to <a href=\"https:\/\/easydmarc.com\/blog\/how-to-secure-your-website-from-cyber-threats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secure your website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter7\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Conclusion<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">JorbanIs Your WordPress Security Expert<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, WordPress is about as secure as could be expected from the world&#8217;s largest CMS platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, as with any platform, there are some security vulnerabilities that you&#8217;ll want to stay ahead of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, there is no such thing as too much security.
