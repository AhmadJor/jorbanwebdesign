You shouldn\u2019t have to alter the overall structure or design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your website just needs minor improvements (such as fixing broken links or improving page load speed), then a website refresh may be all you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to improve your website<\/a> without starting from scratch: a website refresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will you be able to quickly achieve any short-term goals, such as increasing your online presence, but you\u2019ll also likely have enough left in the budget for those unexpected little updates or additions throughout the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, it won\u2019t take nearly as long (or cost nearly as much) as starting from square one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a Website Redesign?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a website redesign is more like demolishing an old building and building a brand new one in its place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website redesign will involve reworking the entire structure of your site to improve user experience and make it easier for people to find information quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of project can include nearly anything, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changing layout designs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating new navigation elements<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding new pages or sections<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Installing plugins or third-party software programs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating third-party tools such as analytics tracking systems or customer relationship management (CRM) systems into the site<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything that requires significant changes to the back-end code of your existing site would fall into this category.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website redesign can be an excellent choice for those in the market for their long-term goals \u2014 and have more cash to spare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know which is which, you can better decide which approach is right for your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes, it\u2019s still hard to decide. If that\u2019s the case, keep reading as we discuss when it makes sense to get a refresh and redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">When a Website Refresh Makes Sense<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As we said, a website refresh is less expensive and can quickly improve the look of a website without much effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are still critical considerations to make before deciding if it\u2019s worth refreshing your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Website Is Under 3 Years Old<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a website has been around for less than three years, a refresh might be the way to go rather than rebuilding it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites need to age gracefully, keeping content and the look and feel updated and fresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure your site is up-to-date increases customer confidence when making online purchases or engaging with services and helps you stay on top of industry trends and competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most websites can benefit from a refresh every two to three years, although, for some industries like e-commerce, the rate might be more frequent due to ever-changing product offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overall Structure of a Website Is Sound<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes websites can look outdated even if they were built recently. If the overall structure of your website is sound, but it looks like it needs a facelift, then investing in a website refresh may be worth considering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good web design team can take your site\u2019s existing structure and modernize it to look more up-to-date. This can help assure visitors that your business is current and active.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A New SEO Initiative Has Started<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business has just started an SEO initiative or following new <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/copywriting-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">copywriting best practices<\/a>, then a website refresh may be the right move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website refresh can bring all of your web pages up to date with current SEO standards and improve your ranking in the SERPs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can include optimizing titles, meta descriptions, and other elements that will give your site an edge in search engine rankings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafting fresh content that includes relevant SEO keywords is also key to scoring even higher in SERPs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Only Looking for Cosmetic Improvements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1025\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34910\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Youre-Only-Looking-for-Cosmetic-Improvements-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A website refresh may be the perfect solution to give your site a little extra sparkle and let the world know that you\u2019re keeping up with modern trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn\u2019t have to mean costly overhauls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing says \u201cI\u2019m current!\u201d like subtle changes \u2014 custom graphics, fonts, or adding interactive elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your site alive and healthy, no matter how much time has passed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a simple update, you will set your website up for success!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">When a Website Redesign Makes Sense<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking for an overhaul, a website redesign better suits your needs.

The average <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-lifespan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website lifespan<\/a> is four years before you should consider taking a step back and redesigning it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redesigns can be a pain, so there\u2019s no need to get them done too frequently. Roughly every two to five years should do the trick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A revamp can make all the difference \u2014 it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to bring a site up to date regarding design standards, technology, and usability for visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, if you want your website to look just as sharp as your outfit on any given day, don\u2019t wait too long before providing those pixels a refresh!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Company Has Rapidly Grown<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to success, sometimes change is the way to go \u2014 and when it comes to your website, that\u2019s doubly true!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business has been on the rise lately, you should think about redesigning the look and style of your online presence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only can this give a modern touch to old websites, but it could also help introduce new customers to your unique goods or services. The best way to do that is to apply excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/about-us-page-copywriting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">About Us copywriting<\/a> to your redesign process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing an accurate and up-to-date version of who you are will also make <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-navigation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website navigation<\/a> easier for returning customers and show them that your brand is as strong as ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Change definitely can be a good thing \u2014 especially for your website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Website\u2019s Technology Is Hard To Manage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time, even the most lovingly designed website needs a tune-up \u2014 including an upgrade to its backbone platform and technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may require effort, it can also be an exciting opportunity to give your site a fresh new look, improved loading speeds, and easier-to-manage content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re using clunky old technology or taking advantage of the latest options available, ensuring your website is running on a platform that can support its current needs and where it\u2019s heading is essential for smooth sailing \u2014 both now and in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Business Goals Are Strikingly Different From That of Your Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if the goals of your business have changed significantly since developing the original version of your site, then it may be worth considering a website redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But mainly if those changes are reflected in any significant marketing materials or advertising campaigns you\u2019ve recently launched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website should always accurately reflect the goals and objectives of a business. Otherwise, customers will be confused by what they find on each page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if small changes have been made to the overall mission statement or branding elements over time, updating these features on the site itself can help create consistency throughout all communication channels with potential customers and clients alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">You can better grasp your goals and alignment if you craft a thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-redesign-project-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website redesign project plan<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER four<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Refresh or Redesign &#8211; Either Way, JorbanCan Help!<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A refresh can be the perfect way to go when you need a website to revamp.
