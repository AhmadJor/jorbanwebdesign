There are solid reasons why video content stands tall above other types of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While having <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/service-page-design-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">high converting service page designs<\/a> improves website engagement, creative videos are even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/state-of-video-marketing-new-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">86% of businesses now use video as a marketing tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out below why businesses have favored video above other forms of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Video is a Combination of Different Content Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Video-is-a-combination-of-different-content-forms.jpg\" alt=\"Video is a combination of different content forms\" class=\"wp-image-33174\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is a good <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/inbound-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">inbound marketing strategy<\/a> because it is a combination of different types of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A video contains words, images, music, animation and other content forms. This factor makes it more potent and popular than individual types of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With video, you get the combined value of the other content forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Video Comes in a Variety of Forms and Structures<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Video has an exciting variety of options to choose from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a

animation<\/a>, intro videos, and motion graphics, among others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can explore different types of videos depending on your audience and product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Video is More Accessible<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People find it easier to watch videos than to read text thereby making it accessible to more people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, not everyone can read but everyone can understand a well-made video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, people have different languages and this can be a barrier to words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with videos, this barrier is broken and everyone can be reached regardless of the language they speak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little wonder videos go viral faster than other forms of content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Video Delivers More Information in a Short Period<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The time it will take to explain a concept in words is shortened with the use of videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The message you will need a thousand words to express can be delivered within a few seconds of video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, video saves the time of your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An internet user will prefer to watch a 30 seconds video than spend 10 minutes reading the same message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\"

Videos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Originality is one of the first tips you should master while creating videos for engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lower possibility of your videos getting engaged or going viral if you are reusing other people\u2019s videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you create original videos, it is fresh in the eyes of your audience and they are more fascinated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not to say you can&#8217;t use other people\u2019s videos if it will boost engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can recreate a video by doing a cover of it creatively to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">improve your website<\/a> and boost engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just ensure you\u2019re not violating any copyright laws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Advantage of Text to Speech Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Take-advantage-of-text-to-speech-technology-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"Take advantage of text to speech technology\" class=\"wp-image-33175\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the evolution of artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amberscript.com\/en\/speech-to-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">text to speech<\/a> technology plays an important role in creating engaging videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this technology, you can add voice-overs to your video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will make your video easily understood by your audience and increase engagement on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to have a competitive edge and increase engagement on your website, consider adopting the text to speech technology for your videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It usually involves you uploading a text file from your device unto a speech app of your choice, selecting your preferred voice and picking a speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a Homepage Explainer Video<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For better engagement from the visitors to your website, consider creating a homepage explainer video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video should quickly explain what your organization or product is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many visitors rarely read the long \u2018About\u2019 page; a short video will pass across the message more effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video should describe what your business or product is about and how your visitor can benefit from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having such a video on your website will give you more engagement than having just the traditional \u2018About\u2019 page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tell a Story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tell-a-story.jpg\" alt=\"Tell a story\" class=\"wp-image-33176\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Videos are powerful engagement tools but not bland or plain ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educative and informative videos become more effective when they tell stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People want to watch videos that tell stories they can relate to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t want to spend their precious minutes watching long boring text and pictures or animation that just pass information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go the extra length with your video content if you want to increase engagement on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can tell a story about your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your visitor know why you do what you do and what impact you\u2019re making in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show your audience why they matter to your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make them feel like a part of your brand through engaging videos that tell relatable stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in Quality Videos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important criteria your video content must fulfill is quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how creative the script is, if the video quality is poor, the purpose is defeated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one wants to watch a poorly made video, no matter how interesting it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of your video plays a huge role in determining the amount of engagement you get on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video quality also has to do with the time it takes for your video to load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good quality videos load fast and reduce the bounce rate of visitors on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor quality videos, on the other hand, increase bounce rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the attention span on the internet is short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do thorough research on <a href=\"https:\/\/visme.co\/blog\/video-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to make quality videos<\/a> and follow best practices. If it is outside your turf, get professionals to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any investment you make on producing quality videos will yield good ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important that you do not compromise on quality if your goal is to increase engagement on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Annotations, Visual Cues and Call to Action<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/summalinguae.com\/data\/video-annotation-what-am-i-looking-at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Video annotation<\/a> involves tagging or labeling video clips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you annotate your videos, it becomes easier for computers using AI-powered algorithms to recognize objects in videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annotation promotes a deeper understanding of the video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual cues control where viewers look in your videos. They include symbols and signs that help viewers focus on the intended message. They make videos more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call to action or CTA helps visitors take concrete action on your website, thereby increasing engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the video tells viewers to click on a link to move to the next step of the user journey, you\u2019re building more engagement for your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Videos with Human Hosts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Make-videos-with-human-hosts.jpg\" alt=\"Make videos with human hosts\" class=\"wp-image-33177\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Make videos with human hosts<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much as animations and other <a href=\"https:\/\/geekflare.com\/best-ai-powered-video-maker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-powered videos<\/a> have their allure, you should consider using human hosts in your videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a human connection in these videos that cannot be duplicated by AI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People relate better to content when watching and listening to a fellow human being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human-hosted videos are more appealing, leading to greater engagement on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Videos Short<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Much as it has been established that videos are an effective tool for engagement, long videos are not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing videos should be short and straight to the point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting out videos that are too long can discourage your audience and make them stop watching before your message is delivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attention span on the internet is very limited and you should keep this in mind when creating video content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is recommended that marketing videos should not be more than two minutes. Anything more than that can be counterproductive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER three<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Start Using Videos to Increase Engagement on Your Website Today<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is one of the most potent forms of content out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because it combines different forms of content, is easily accessible, comes in a variety of forms and structures, and delivers more information in a short period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use videos to increase engagement on your website, ensure you create original videos, take advantage of text to speech technology, and create a homepage explainer video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways you can improve the traffic and activity on your website include telling a story with your videos, investing in quality videos, and making videos with human hosts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of annotations, visual cues and call to action (CTA) has also proven to be very effective in growing website engagement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Videos can help to increase engagement on your website, find out how here!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":42598,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":""},"categories":[41],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v20.9 (Yoast SEO v20.13) -
