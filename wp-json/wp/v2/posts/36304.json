This includes all forms of media, from text to videos and images.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Operable<\/strong>: All users should have access to every feature on your site. This includes items such as navigational elements and form fields.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Understandable<\/strong>: Users should comprehend the content on your website, which encompasses not only the written text but also any visual indicators (e.g., icons).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Robust<\/strong>: Your site must be compatible with assistive technologies so that all users, including those with disabilities, can access your content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1025\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative Text for Images Graphics and Videos\" class=\"wp-image-35009\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/What-Is-Accessibility-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alternative Text for Images Graphics and Videos<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, web content should be easy to perceive, operate, and understand, as well as robust enough to work with assistive technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these guidelines, website owners can help ensure everyone can enjoy their content, regardless of ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER two<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">What Does Accessibility Look Like for Web Design and Development?<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand what accessibility means for your website, it\u2019s time to learn how to incorporate those principles into your web design and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web development<\/a> processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure your site is accessible involves following best practices for coding, testing, and overall design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most critical accessibility elements to keep in mind for your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keyboard Inputs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever been surfing the web and thought, \u201cMan, I really wish I didn\u2019t have to use a mouse to click on everything\u201d?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No? Just us?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, accessible websites allow users to use the keyboard for website functionality rather than just relying on a mouse to navigate the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows users to navigate through your website without using a computer mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, they can use the tab key to move between various elements on a page and the enter key to select an element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, they can also use shortcuts like \u201cCtrl+F\u201d to find specific content on a page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Screen Readers Accessibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Screen readers are used to reading various web pages to the user by converting the text on the page into a synthesized voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common type of screen reader is a text-to-speech program that you can run on a personal computer or a mobile device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These programs are designed to work with various web browsers and operating systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is essential to keep screen readers in mind when developing a website. This means designing your website efficiently for a screen reader to navigate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, use clear and concise text and ensure that all links are clearly labeled. Avoid using images that rely on color to convey meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative Text for Images, Graphics, and Videos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1025\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Navigation v3\" class=\"wp-image-35010\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos.jpg 1025w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Alternative-Text-for-Images-Graphics-and-Videos-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Clear Navigation v3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt text, or alternative text, is the written content that appears in place of an image on a web page if the image fails to load on a user\u2019s screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201calt tags\u201d or \u201calt descriptions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While alt text may seem like a minor detail in the design of a website, it\u2019s an essential factor in creating an accessible site for all users, including those with visual impairments who are using screen readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being essential for accessibility, alt text also plays a role in SEO (search engine optimization). That\u2019s because search engines scour the internet for words and phrases that help the deliver relevant results to users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they see images on a website, they look to the alt text to understand what the image depicts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, including descriptive alt text can help improve a website\u2019s ranking in search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conveying Key Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing forms for your website, it\u2019s crucial to think about how to make the form fields as user-friendly as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to do this is to use an asterisk in your forms. By including an asterisk next to the required fields, you can help people who may have difficulty understanding your form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, using an asterisk can help people who are using screen readers navigate your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By making your key information more accessible, you can help improve your website\u2019s overall usability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clear Navigation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever been on a website and needed to know where you were or how to get where you needed to go, but nothing makes sense?
