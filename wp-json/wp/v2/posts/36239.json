Lifestyle images are all about telling the brand story. Your product images can (and should) have a lot of punch on their own, but product images against a white or solid background do not stir the kind of emotions that they do \u201cin action\u201d.

It\u2019s an essential tool that combines information with emotion in a way that sticks in people\u2019s heads and motivates them to take action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using color is another way to tell your brand story.

They usually talk about the product only from the brand\u2019s perspective. Reviews, on the other hand, allow customers to read others\u2019 experiences and glean information from them that they might not otherwise get.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For instance, you might see comments like: \u201cthe shoe was stiff and took about a week to break in\u201d or \u201cthe color was slightly darker than how it looked in the photo\u201d or \u201cthe material is even softer than I expected\u201d and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/17-customer-comments-1024x304.webp\" alt=\"17 customer comments\" class=\"wp-image-32338\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.outdoorvoices.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Outdoor Voices<\/a> displays their reviews at the bottom of the product page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">18<strong> Social engagement builds trust and credibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social media is amazing, both for customer service and for connecting directly to your audience. Depending on the platform (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), you have the ability to respond to any reviews that come in and to address questions and negative reviews in a timely manner. This shows other customers that you truly care and will work to resolve issues. It also helps to build trust and credibility over time, two things you simply cannot buy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/18-Social-engagement-1024x304.webp\" alt=\"18 Social engagement\" class=\"wp-image-32339\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.allbirds.com\/products\/womens-wool-runners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Allbirds<\/a> uses a social Instagram feed on each product page so customers can see photos of other people wearing the shoes they\u2019re looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">19 <strong>User-generated content builds authenticity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>User-generated content (UGC) \u2013 content that your customers (or influencers) post of themselves or others using your products \u2013 helps to build authenticity. It allows the brand to seem more accessible because it shows that there are real people using it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>UGC is also a way for the brand to amass great content and imagery they might not otherwise have. Brands such as MVMT thrive off UGC on their Instagram and PDPs.
