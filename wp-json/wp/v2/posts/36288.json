How are you standing out against the growing pool of competition?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With product videos, it might not be something that every eCommerce business is doing and that\u2019s a good thing. You\u2019re standing out from the crowd and providing your customers with more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video marketing is just another way of helping bolster the customer\u2019s experience of your brand via the creation of entertaining and informative videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to ask yourself, what reason do your customers have to choose you as a business to buy from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand awareness takes time to build up. It\u2019s about generating trust in what you\u2019re selling. It\u2019s also about encouraging your customers to come back again and again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer loyalty is a great benefit for your business. When you satisfy existing customers with media like videos, it has a ripple effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, a study found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/customer-loyalty-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">satisfied US customers will share their positive experiences<\/a> with 11 different people.

Not just for the reason of keeping your customers on the page but to explain the product\u2019s use in full.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find ways to showcase how this product is a solution to that user\u2019s pain points in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By creating this connection through video content, it helps build brand trust and loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Helps Explain the Most Complex Products<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Helps-explain-the-most-complex-products.jpg\" alt=\"Helps explain the most complex products\" class=\"wp-image-33249\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be some products you sell that require more explanation than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A video is really helpful in answering questions that the customer may have about the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an engaging video, it helps to show the customer something that is otherwise difficult to grasp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways in which this is done, whether it\u2019s animation or voiceover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person could also be in the video, showing the user how to operate the product successfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help to draw your customer&#8217;s attention in, in order to get them to buy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without that product video, the customer may find enough to convince them not to make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Appeals Greatly to Mobile Users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile users benefit greatly from product videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With most people nowadays owning a smartphone, eCommerce is directly accessible to those customers who may shop on the go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From their morning commute to their lunch break at work, mobile shopping is growing in popularity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile eCommerce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/insights\/mobile-commerce-shopping-trends-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sales for retail hit $359.32 billion<\/a> in 2021.
