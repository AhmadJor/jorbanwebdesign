Start by knowing exactly what you need your About Us page to accomplish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors on this page want to know more about you. That means everything on this page has to be about you, the business, not your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be counter-intuitive if you&#8217;re trained to think about customers first. This page is one of the few exceptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chapter will help you define 5 core goals that every About Us page needs to accomplish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-telling-the-story-of-your-business\">1. Telling The Story of Your Business<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every superhero has an origin story. Every business does, too. Yours might not be quite as exciting or tragic as that of Bruce Wayne, but your company story is still worth telling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulldog Skincare, for example, was founded by two friends who were frustrated by the lack of natural options in the men&#8217;s skincare market. It\u2019s a great example of what <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/beauty-and-cosmetic-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beauty website design<\/a> can be. Cupcakes and Cashmere started as a DIY blog and has since become a multimillion-dollar business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lonely Planet was founded by two Aussies who quit their jobs, sold all their possessions, and set off on a round-the-world trip. And Yellow Leaf Hammocks was started by a former fashion executive who was looking for a way to give back to her native Thailand. These businesses have all achieved success thanks to their unique stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your about us page content wins if it successfully tells the story of your business. Where did you come from, and why did you start it? How did you get where you are today? It needs to use your brand voice and convey the core brand messages you want the world to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you build the page, put it to a test. Show the text to someone who\u2019s not familiar with your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading it once, can they recount your story? If so, you\u2019re on the right path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-explaining-your-cause-and-core-mission\">2. Explaining Your Cause and Core Mission<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second goal of this page has to do with the deeper mission you have. This is your opportunity to explain your motivations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your reason for existence, and it&#8217;s closely connected to your story. Think of it as the reason behind why you started a business, to begin with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35688\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/zenefits-mission-statement-compressor-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t think of it as your mission statement, though. Instead, think of it as your core audience, and your mission in a more abstract sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accomplishing this goal is an opportunity to set yourself apart from your competition. Your cause might just be unique enough that it convinces your audience that you&#8217;re the right choice for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, your about page should be an extension of your content marketing efforts and overall content strategy: you want to promote the unique value proposition of your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-revealing-your-business-model\">3. Revealing Your Business Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What can you say about the way your business is run now? This goal gets you from history and hypotheticals into the presence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about exactly what type of business you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even get into how your products are made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those details matter, especially if your business model is in itself a selling point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can add transparency that your competitors don&#8217;t offer. It allows you to go into sustainability or domestic manufacturing. You can even talk about low price in a way that doesn&#8217;t seem cheap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-showing-the-face-s-of-your-business\">4.

Showcase your team, from its founders to the people answering the phone when a customer calls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple pictures can go a long way to accomplish this goal. You can also add some unique facts about each team member to add some personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the direction you choose, this goal helps you make sure your audience can get to know you just as you try to learn about them.

They only matter if you can translate them into compelling writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copywriting can make or break your About Us page. Get it right, and your audience won&#8217;t be able to forget about you. Get it wrong, and your visitors will forget you even exist as soon as they close their browser window.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure is on. Fortunately, you can follow these 5 best practices for great copywriting on your About page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-show-your-personality\">1. Show Your Personality<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your audience doesn&#8217;t want to read bland statements that they could find anywhere.<br>If you go that route, they&#8217;ll forget about you in a heartbeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be memorable, you need a compelling brand personality. Writing can give you that personality.<br>Building a personality means being memorable. That includes being clear about your values, leaning into instead of shying away from strong opinions, and being human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your writing can consistently hit these points, you&#8217;re on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-avoid-jargon-and-business-speak\">2. Avoid Jargon and Business Speak<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jargon is the death of good copywriting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might know what that word means. Your audience doesn&#8217;t. They&#8217;ll just get upset that you are making them think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35690\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/good-on-you-language-compressor-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why the About Us page should avoid jargon and business-speak at all costs.<br>It&#8217;s easier said than done. We all slip into this habit naturally, because we live those topics we&#8217;re writing about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the best test is getting your text in front of someone who isn&#8217;t familiar with their industry. Can they easily understand every sentence you write? Good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-don-t-be-afraid-to-focus-on-you-not-them\">3. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Focus on You (Not Them)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on your audience has become such an important best marketing practice, it&#8217;s almost a cliche. For your About page, you&#8217;ll need to break that habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your chance to talk about you. Not your customers. Not even your industry or larger environment. Just you, the company they want to learn about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to brag. Add badges, testimonials from clients, and accomplishments or milestones. Putting the focus on yourself takes some practice, but it goes a long way towards writing a compelling page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-weave-in-personal-stories\">4. Weave in Personal Stories<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To call storytelling a trend in marketing would be misleading. It\u2019s been around as long as humanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s just beginning to re-enter the marketing world. That\u2019s because emotions drive purchasing decisions, probably because they\u2019re much more memorable than facts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On your about page, you can become a storyteller. Talk about your personal journey and that of the company. Make it a compelling narrative your audience can\u2019t stop reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-follow-a-story-framework\">5. Follow a Story Framework<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of stories: they only work if they follow the classic 5-part storytelling framework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Problem:<\/strong> The protagonist (your company) encounters something that hinders or handicaps them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Epiphany:<\/strong> There&#8217;s a groundbreaking idea that can solve the problem in a way that&#8217;s never been done.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Challenge:<\/strong> It&#8217;s not easy to turn that idea into reality, but the protagonist works hard on it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Success:<\/strong> With hard work, the protagonist overcomes the challenge and solves the problem.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future:<\/strong> The protagonist takes steps to make sure that no one has to encounter that same problem again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds a lot like a business origin story, right? Follow that framework, and you&#8217;re on the right path.<br>The writing is done. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve followed these best copywriting practices while staying within your goals, you&#8217;ve won half the About page battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time for the other half.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 4<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Best Practices For Effective Design Of About Us Pages<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>With the text in place, it&#8217;s time to focus on the visuals. That means getting your page design for the About Us page just right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every piece of the story you tell is text-based. Nor should it be. Some crucial components are much better when told visually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll help you avoid a <a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-fix-bad-website-designs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bad website design<\/a> by focusing on the design and layout steps you can take to maximize the potential and user experience of your About page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-when-in-doubt-go-visual\">1. When in Doubt, Go Visual<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your audience loves visuals. They&#8217;ll be 4 times more likely to remember images than text. Give them what they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to add logos and icons for any brands you&#8217;ve worked with. Including the icons of any press mentions should be straightforward. You need images of your team and leadership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also get more complex. Use graphics to show your business model or how your products are made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Centivo Value Stats\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/375771313?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in doubt, trend visual. If you can represent it in a graphic and not lose its essence, you&#8217;re probably better off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-design-for-skimmers\">2. Design for Skimmers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Never assume that your audience reads every word of this page or others. Heck, even in this guide you&#8217;ve probably skipped around and landed on this page title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2008 study found that the average web user reads less than 20% of a page&#8217;s content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a usability study from the same year showed that if a piece of content wasn&#8217;t placed in a scannable place like a headline or subheader, only 1 of 15 users could remember it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are that in the last 12 years, it&#8217;s only gotten worse. You simply need to assume that your audience won&#8217;t read everything you write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, design your About Us page for skimmers. Include lots of whitespace, keep the paragraphs short, and highlight key points and numbers with graphics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, make it abundantly obvious who you are and what you do. If you think you&#8217;ve gone far enough, take it further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-match-visuals-to-your-personality\">3. Match Visuals to Your Personality<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock photos are never enough. Playing it safe won&#8217;t get your audience&#8217;s attention. Instead, your photography and any visual assets on this site need to match your personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re playful, be playful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"467\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35691\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467-300x137.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467-768x350.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467-24x11.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467-36x16.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/basic-team-photos-compressor-1024x467-48x22.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re suited up and traditional, don&#8217;t show your CEO in a t-shirt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency is key. The personality you&#8217;ve built in your writing needs to shine through in your visuals as well. Anything else introduces cognitive dissonance and turns off your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-adjust-content-length-for-your-brand-type\">4. Adjust Content-Length for Your Brand Type<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have expected an ideal length for About pages in this guide. In truth, there isn&#8217;t one.<br>Instead, it all depends on both your business and your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For personal brands, for instance, long form letters tend to work well. They allow you to explain your background and connect you (the person) with you (the brand).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true for entertainment or consumer good services, which have to work with audiences who&#8217;s attention span is minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same skimmable best practices from above always apply. Beyond that, make sure you match your content length and layout to your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 5<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Tell the World More About You<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s it! With the right goals, writing, and design, you can create a great about us page. The impact you\u2019ll have with that page is significant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the page that sets your business apart. It positions you as different and unique, while the tone for the entire buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it a core piece of your website. One study found that visitors to about pages are more likely to make purchases, and spend more when they do. Another found that 75% of a company\u2019s credibility is based on its website and a large chunk of that comes down to this one page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting there means starting with your goals, but it also means writing with a distinct personality and telling a compelling story. You have to be memorable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, you need to make sure that your content is visually appealing and easily skimmable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your turn: does this help you build your own about us page?

You can also include information about your team, your customers, and your partners. A well-designed about us page will help your audience understand what you do and why you do it. It should be easy to navigate and easy to read.
