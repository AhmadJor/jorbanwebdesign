The purpose is to draw customers to your website by presenting them with helpful, interesting, and relevant content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User-tailored experiences are possible thanks to dynamically generated smart content that can be delivered in many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it could be based upon remembering the visitor\u2019s name to greet them when they return to your <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/best-content-for-a-homepage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">homepage<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, it may be able to remember previous purchases and be used in future product recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/ecommerce-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ecommerce sites<\/a> like Amazon implement dynamic content to recommend products that customers who have already purchased something similar might appreciate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also how websites can promote themselves on other sites using their own generated ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever done a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/product-page-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">product<\/a> search on one website in the morning and found the same or similar items on another website later in the day, this explains why!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a Dynamic Page?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic web pages are those which allow users to interact with the content on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever a user visits this page, the page remembers their preferences and utilizes that user data information to create engaging content experiences for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time a user accesses a dynamic page, data from the previous visits will completely customize the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-create-an-effective-ux-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">user experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example of a dynamic page is the YouTube homepage. Think about how difficult it would be to go through all the videos added to YouTube every month to find the ones that are most relevant to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YouTube employs scripting to keep track of what you\u2019ve searched for and what you\u2019ve viewed or liked before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you return to their website, you\u2019ll only see video recommendations tailored to your interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Dynamic Content Marketing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic content marketing is a type of digital marketing that involves showing customized content to users based on their interactions with a company&#8217;s website. This content is designed to be relevant and interesting to the user, in hopes of prompting them to make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a dynamic content marketing strategy allows companies to tailor their message to specific users. This results in a higher chance of increased conversion, as the user is seeing content that is relevant to their interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, dynamic content marketing as a part of an overall online marketing strategy can be used to increase sales and boost conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Static Content vs. Dynamic Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a dynamic content website exists, then static content does as well. Let\u2019s discuss the differences between the two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated.jpg\" alt=\"How Can Personalization Be Implemented\" class=\"wp-image-35274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Is-Dynamic-Content-Generated-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">How Can Personalization Be Implemented<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Is Dynamic Content Generated?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic content is created via a database of stored information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the website remembers the user\u2019s name whenever they return because of a database that organizes files of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User-provided data\u2014such as names, email addresses, purchase history, and other personal details\u2014serves as the source for this information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, dynamic content for websites is driven by applications and server-side scripts. These apps work in tandem with the web server to process user requests, generate dynamic content, and then deliver that content to the user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Is Static Content Generated?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a site user accesses static content, it means that it has not been generated, updated, or processed before it was delivered to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Static content is among the easiest and most efficient forms of online content because the server transmits the same files to every user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A newspaper is a good analogy for static content. Anyone who purchases a copy of a newspaper will see the same stories and photos regardless of any events that may have occurred during the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating static content, HTML files are used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything collected for dynamic web content is not used and disregarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although static content is less engaging, it\u2019s easier to store, parse, and deliver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER twO<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Personalization for Websites<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to marketing, consumers demand content based on customization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/ecommerce\/web-personalisation\/consumers-personalized-marketing-engagement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">72% of shoppers<\/a>, they only interact with marketing messages that are relevant to their interests. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/_acnmedia\/PDF-77\/Accenture-Pulse-Survey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">91% say<\/a> they prefer to buy from companies that make recommendations that are specifically tailored to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Personalization of Websites?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Website personalization is a method for tailoring the user experience based on the information gathered from dynamic content databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user visits a website, personalized recommendations are created based on the user\u2019s previous browsing history and regular online habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is determined by the data provided by the user, their demographics, their preferences, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main objective of web personalization is to improve the customer experience by anticipating and meeting their needs and preferences before they are expressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can Personalization Be Implemented?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented.jpg\" alt=\"Learn More About Your Audience\" class=\"wp-image-35275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented-768x495.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented-36x23.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/How-Can-Personalization-Be-Implemented-48x31.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Learn More About Your Audience<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization can be implemented using the information collected in databases. Reliable data is the foundation for creating personalized experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web content personalization works best when you know as much as possible about your guests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding a personal touch using different forms of dynamic content is simple if you have the right data to work with. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to be an expert in data collection to get the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding out which type of content your website\u2019s users want is as simple as using the appropriate tools and looking in the right places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you can use cookies, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/contact-forms-that-convert\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contact forms<\/a>, CTAs, and the like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this needs to be done ethically. With more and more companies collecting data from their users every day, privacy has been a big ethical issue and a matter of debate for several years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there have been several studies and even court cases surrounding the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should be allowed to decide how much information they want to disclose and what data is collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, make it possible for them to opt out of sharing their information with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, when implementing dynamic content on your web pages, make sure your users know what information they\u2019re giving you and that you have their permission to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, although cookies are frequently used to gather information about users, several third-party services allow users to prohibit cookies from being added to their browsers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some web browsers have even incorporated features to block cookies and safeguard their users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the user\u2019s consent is a good rule of thumb when dealing with personal information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can You Do to Personalize Your Website?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided that personalization is the right path to your website\u2019s success, here are some steps you can take to implement it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn More About Your Audience<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t relate to somebody if you don&#8217;t know their background. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, your first step will be to have a better understanding of your audience. You&#8217;ll be able to get a lot of information about your market thanks to personalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will be able to determine the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Behavior: You&#8217;ll discover how your visitors use your website, what they&#8217;re looking at, and how they ended up there in the first place.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Demographic: This is where you will learn who your customer is and where they are from. In the context of <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-corporate-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">B2B website design<\/a>, you can also learn more about their business, such as how many employees they have, the industry they operate in, and so forth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contextual information: This includes information about your user&#8217;s situation, such as the device they are using to access your website, whether they are a first-time visitor or a returning one, and if they are an organic visitor or a referral visitor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the information and data acquired, you can create different CTAs based on whether your website visitor matches the parameters such as company size, industry, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one CTA could direct users to contact your sales team, then another could direct them to sign-up for a free account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customize Testimonials<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to show your customers what you\u2019re best in is to use customer testimonials. They serve as social proof, which builds your company\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability, ultimately leading to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">better conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing customer testimonials can be tailored to attract new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your customer is B2B, share a B2B testimonial. In the same way, if your customer is an online shopper, show an ecommerce testimonial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feature Content That Is of Interest to Users<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Content like blog posts, case studies, downloadables, and the like are excellent tools for educating potential buyers about your product or service.<br>By using personalization and the data collected, you can show those leads other content that interests them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customizing a user\u2019s experience on your website is possible using firmographic data (such as the industry they work in) and behavioral data (such as the blog articles they\u2019ve read).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even from an ecommerce perspective, this is still the case!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potential buyers can see items that appeal to them based on their past purchasing behavior, their most recent searches, or even items related to their earlier searches or purchases, among other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author.jpg 200w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/mike-cleary-author-48x48.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Every website experience has its native user flows and paths that users can organically take.
