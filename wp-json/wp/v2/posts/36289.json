You can purchase premium Drupal themes if you don\u2019t want to keep creating your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal is more of a DIY platform. It\u2019s an open-source CMS, so it can be easy and challenging to edit. It\u2019s easy if you know how to code and complicated if you don\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal requires knowledge of different computer languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/themes\/getting-started\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress themes<\/a> are developed with code that WordPress generates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users don\u2019t need to know how to code to create a WordPress theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need is creativity and some knowledge of CSS. You can find free and paid themes on their website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this round, WordPress wins because they have superior non-technical editing options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s more friendly for marketing managers and teams who want to design their own website without learning to code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Redesigning<\/a> also becomes possible!

Drupal makes it easier for developers to manage plugins, while WordPress gives more freedom to its users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both provide thousands of plugins that you can maximize for a website that\u2019s unique to your brand!<br>When it comes to quality control, however, WordPress wins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a handbook for designers and developers, so even beginners can create amazing plugins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal also has a bunch of resources, letting outside developers create modules specifically for Drupal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, users must have developer knowledge of Drupal\u2019s coding standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/SEO-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"SEO\" class=\"wp-image-33280\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal and WordPress differ in the way they approach SEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal has a module that takes care of all your SEO needs, while WordPress has a plugin that does the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that your CMS doesn\u2019t directly affect your SEO ranking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is more about the quality of your content, how you use keywords, and how you structure your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal\u2019s approach is to give users the ability to customize their website according to the latest SEO practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its core modules take care of site performance, security, and other technical aspects that Google considers in its ranking algorithm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal also has a module that creates XML sitemaps, which is vital for search engine crawlers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress, on the other hand, takes a more hands-off approach. It uses a popular plugin, Yoast SEO, to handle all your SEO needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast SEO is a plugin that helps you with keyword research, site structure, and content optimization. It might be just a plugin, but it works great and keeps up with the latest SEO trends!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Drupal vs WordPress SEO debate, it\u2019s a tie. The two have plugins and modules that ensure your website is aligned with the latest SEO practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Caleb-square.jpg\" alt=\"Caleb square\" class=\"wp-image-29375\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Both Drupal and WordPress have evolved from small systems into powerful content management platforms.

Both ensure that users know all about the latest threats and have the tools to protect their websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, WordPress has had several <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-security-issues-and-concerns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">security issues and concerns<\/a>.

With WordPress, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/wordpress-performance-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">performance optimization<\/a> becomes more challenging to schedule according to its updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for support for your website, both CMSs have a large community to turn to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal\u2019s guidelines for various categories and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">support pages<\/a> allow you to find the help you need.<br>WordPress also has a dedicated page for support and a vast community in its forums. The two don\u2019t leave you after you create your website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Drupal<\/a> has over one million developers in its community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/websitesetup.org\/news\/wordpress-statistics-facts\/#:~:text=How%20Many%20WordPress%20Developers%20Are,about%20how%20many%20there%20are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress<\/a>, however, it\u2019s difficult to tell how because many work freelance while some have their own business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s safe to say that there are more WordPress developers than Drupal.

manage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that has much more to do with the craftsman (developer) than with the tool (WordPress).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-built <a

business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an excellent solution for <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/small-and-midsized-business-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mid-sized

data-driven sites, Drupal has an edge.
