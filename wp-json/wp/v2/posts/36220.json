This information is crucial to establish the identity of your brand and will help inform many design decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-corporate-identity-guideline\">Corporate Identity Guideline<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate Identity Guidelines help define how your company is presented to the public. Perhaps similar to a more far-reaching brand book, this guideline includes the design parameters that a website must adhere to. Among other things, it will provide rules for color palettes, logo use, and the typography to be used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-journey-map-cjm\">Customer Journey Map (CJM)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UX term, &#8220;Customer Journey Map&#8221; is a diagram used to illustrate how customers will interact with your website. Researching this behavior to fill in the CJM will help you understand how to best improve the user experience and address any problems that users might have with your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-design-thinking\">Design Thinking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 5-step method that may help you overcome problems in the design process.

The problem is written on the \u201chead\u201d of the fish, while its causes and the factors leading up to it are written along its spine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-flowchart\">Flowchart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flowcharts are used to outline the procedure for a given task on a project. This diagram is useful in visualizing the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to move forward through subsequent steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35591\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/04-gamification-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gamification\">Gamification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using ideas and concepts borrowed from game design, gamification is a useful tool to increase user engagement. The idea is to provide some additional motivation that lets users better enjoy your site. This might include some sort of incentivization, such as providing points or goals that users can strive for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gestalt-principles\">Gestalt Principles<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The principles of gestalt theory can apply to design on a broader spectrum but are definitely relevant to UX. This principle establishes that people often visually perceive items as part of a whole rather than individual parts. They tend to observe things in the context of their similarity or difference to their surroundings. With this in mind, consider how all the visual elements of your website interact with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-human-computer-interaction\">Human-Computer Interaction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This field explores how people design and interact with computer technology. Studying how we use them can provide the basis for exploring different modes of interaction with your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mental-model\">Mental Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mental model is a diagram used to chart a user\u2019s perception of how something works. Keep in mind, a product that more closely resembles this thought process will be easier to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mindmap\">Mindmap<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mindmap is another way to organize information, often around a central idea. Both words and images can be used in this diagram to visualize concepts related to this idea. This can also show how they relate to each other and encourage new ideas to branch out from that initial concept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/05-persona-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-persona\">Persona<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;Persona&#8221; is common across a few different job focuses (Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and UX). Personas are essentially mock user profiles to help you imagine what your audience wants. Research helps establish a target audience for you to build your design around. It practically goes without saying, but different groups of people have different goals and interests that they\u2019re seeking, and a bland or generalist design won\u2019t cut it. Having a design that appeals to your audience increases their engagement with your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scrum\">Scrum<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scrum is a type of Agile project methodology. It emphasizes iteration and testing, much like Agile, but it typically includes the particulars of how a project will be completed. Assignments are often doled out across short phases (see \u201cSprints\u201d below as well), and typically, specific goals are established during each one. Having this structure in your project management can help keep it on track; each sprint of work provides an opportunity to review and iterate on what came before it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-site-map\">Site map<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A site map is a basic visualization of the structure of a website that lists the pages and hierarchy therein. You&#8217;ll see this often referenced amongst SEO&#8217;s, but is equally important for UX designers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sketching\">Sketching<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Light freehand drawings can help visualize ideas and start brainstorming ways to design your product. They can help communicate what you\u2019re thinking, but this early in the planning process, they aren\u2019t meant to be very detailed or polished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-slack\">Slack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is a popular platform for internal communications. Tools like Slack are incredibly useful in keeping everyone in the loop with the information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sprints\">Sprints<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A defined length of time for an assignment within a project. Particular goals are established in advance, and this period typically lasts a couple of weeks. At the end of a sprint, you can review the work done to acknowledge successes and course-correct any issues that came up. Often times this term is synonymous with software development, but can also be used amongst ux design teams when trying to rapidly solve specific problems for a product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-storyboard\">Storyboard<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Often a critical tool for a UX designer, storyboards are a way to visually communicate how a user might experience a product. By exploring the circumstances that might bring a user to your website, for example, you can plan your design around a solution to their situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-task-analysis\">Task Analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyzing the list of steps it takes a user to complete a given task provides insight into their experience and identifies problems in completing that test. Doing this early in product development lets you plan your design to offer solutions to those problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/06-userflow-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-flow\">User Flow<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another key tool for any UX designer. The user flow displays the intended motions of a user completing a task. Each step is laid out so that there is a logical progression that\u2019s easy to follow. Establishing a clear user flow creates a strong experience to design around as development carries on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-research\">User Research<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To best understand your target audience, user research is crucial. It includes any sort of investigation you do when you set out on your project. Qualitative and quantitative data are both useful, and together they can give you a great picture of your users\u2019 behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-customer-journey-maps\">User\/Customer Journey Maps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User\/Customer journey maps encompass the entire experience a user has with a product. By fleshing out the journey from beginning to end, developers can start planning how they would realize and enhance this experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-stories\">User Stories<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User stories are examples that describe the goals and ideas from the perspective of the user. Creating a clear idea of who this user is by putting yourself in their place is one method of establishing a target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-scenarios\">User Scenarios<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating user scenarios\u2014essentially short stories\u2014can help explain how a customer is going to use it. They\u2019re typically used to describe the situation or context a customer might be in that will lead them to the product. Knowing customers\u2019 goals can help steer the direction of your team\u2019s design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-whiteboard-interview\">Whiteboard Interview<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whiteboard interviews, as the name suggests, are tests in which candidates are given a whiteboard to develop the solution to a given problem. This type of interview tests the knowledge and problem-solving skills of the candidate without them relying on a computer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter2\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">chapter 2<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Visual Design UI\/UX Terms<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-click-rule\">3-click Rule<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In UX, the 3-click rule is the concept that a user is going to leave your website if they can\u2019t accomplish their goal in 3 mouse clicks. If something on your site takes more than 3 clicks to find, it should be worth revisiting the design to make the relevant content easier to access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\" data-service=\"vimeo\" data-responsive=\"true\">\n<div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n<div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/420454547?background=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/420454547?background=1\" data-mce-style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-second-test\">5-Second Test<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5-second test is another way of gauging the effectiveness of a website\u2019s design. In the first 5 seconds of viewing a webpage, the user makes judgments about the page based on their first impressions.

Such websites can detect the platform they\u2019re on, so you would see the relevant version of the site when you access it. This design concept is similar to responsive web design, but adaptive design features distinct layouts for different devices, while responsive design features a single one that adjusts to the size of a given screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-affordance\">Affordance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Affordances are indicators of the function of different design elements on your site.

They\u2019re functions created to enable software to access information from other sources, such as the operating system or other applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-avatar\">Avatar<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Avatar is an image that represents users on a website, perhaps in the absence of a photo of the user themselves. You\u2019ll typically see them in forums or places designed for community interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-back-and-front-end-development\">Back and Front-End Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Back-end development refers to work done in areas that an average user wouldn\u2019t see. This includes organizing and storing the data for a website and measures to make sure everything is working on the front end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, front-end development is the work done for the user-facing website. In other words, front-end development is concerned with how a site functions and how a user interacts with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-backlog\">Backlog<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A backlog is simply the collection of tasks yet to be done.

They can carry out a text \u201cconversation\u201d and are set up to provide answers in the field they were designed for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-color-contrast\">Color Contrast<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, color contrast refers to the difference between two colors and can be differentiated by value, hue, or saturation. It\u2019s another effective tool in website design that helps make elements visually distinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-color-wheel\">Color Wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The color wheel is a circle that visually represents the colors and their relationships with each other. It can be a useful reference while determining the color palette of your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-data-driven-design\">Data-Driven Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data-driven design is exactly what it sounds like: a design that\u2019s backed up by all the studies and research at your disposal. The data helps designers discover new trends and reveals potential challenges that they can focus on overcoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-design-debt\">Design Debt<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design debt refers to elements in a project that need to be fixed or adjusted later in production. Initial haphazard implementation of any given element, which can happen for any number of reasons, usually creates this debt. Of course, it\u2019s always something to be wary of since design debt will ultimately require more work to resolve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dots-per-inch-dpi\">Dots Per Inch (DPI)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dots per inch is a method of measuring the density of an image. Measuring how many dots can fit into a square inch of an image is an indicator of its resolution and size. When adjusting images on a website to be clear and effective, the DPI of the images is one factor that a designer must be aware of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-experience-architecture\">Experience Architecture<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience Architecture is a visual representation of how a user will carry out their task, from the beginning to completion. It encompasses the various systems and functions that a user would interact with as well as the data and analysis to explain each step of their process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fitts-law\">Fitts\u2019 Law<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitts\u2019 Law states that the further away and the smaller an object is from a pointer on a screen, the longer it takes for someone to move the pointer to the object. So, users are much more likely to interact with the larger or more prominent elements of a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35597\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/12-flat-design-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-flat-design\">Flat Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a UI with a flat design entails a minimalistic approach.

It\u2019s particularly useful in responsive web design because the size of the image can be increased or decreased without losing the image\u2019s quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-software\">Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software simply refers to the programs on your computer rather than its physical components (the hardware).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-software-development-kit-sdk\">Software Development Kit (SDK)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SDKs are collections of tools used to create products for a given platform or operating system. An SDK comes \u201cpre-packaged\u201d with the essentials of everything a developer needs to start creating for the given platform. Without an SDK, program development would have to start from scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-technical-debt\">Technical Debt<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coding solutions that technically work but are actually messy or inefficient will create technical debt. Any number of factors can force these problems to occur, but eventually, they\u2019ll need to be resolved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-centered-design-ucd\">User-Centered Design (UCD)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User-centered design maintains the end-user as the focal point of development. Questions asked during work revolve around how they would experience the product and how the experience can be improved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-experience-ux\">User Experience (UX)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, user experience is the sum of a user\u2019s time spent interfacing with a product. It\u2019s what they feel and thinks while using a product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-experience-design-uxd\">User Experience Design (UXD)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User experience design, as the name suggests, is the practice of designing end-user products that are appealing to them. UXD is relevant at just about every step of a product\u2019s development; how a user is going to respond to an element is an ever-present question in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-interface-ui-or-graphical-user-interface-gui\">User Interface (UI), or Graphical User Interface (GUI)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>UI or GUI are the terms for what the user sees on their screen; they include everything the user interacts with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-vertical-rhythm\">Vertical Rhythm<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertical rhythm is the practice of making the size of vertical spaces consistent between different elements of the page.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-waterfall\">Waterfall<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterfall development requires each stage of the process to be complete before moving onto the next. This highly structured approach runs counter to more recent Agile methods, but this structure might still be a boon for certain projects or teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-widget\">Widget<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A widget is a UI element that the user can interact with. They can come in many shapes and sizes but can include buttons or contact forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/14-wireframe-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wireframe\">Wireframe<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A wireframe is a simplified visualization of your website used to show off only its essential information. The most important elements of your product should be present, but overall, it\u2019s still a bare-bones representation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-white-or-negative-space\">White or Negative Space<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty white or negative space can be used to effectively guide users to focus on the important content on the page. If there isn\u2019t enough white space, the page might feel cluttered and end up distracting the user away from your message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/galaxy_bgg.png);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"><\/a>\n<\/div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\" class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/solarSystem.png\"\/><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">chapter 3<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Performance and Reporting Terms<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-b-testing\">A\/B Testing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A\/B testing displays two options for an audience to discover which one is better received. Subsequently, the testers can use this data to proceed and iterate upon the more successful design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-experience-cx\">Customer Experience (CX)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The customer experience is the total summation of interactions that a customer participates in with a brand or product they enjoy. One might consider examining CX as user experience with a more explicitly sales-oriented approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-clickstream\">Clickstream<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyzing the clickstream, or the tracking of visits to a website enables developers to respond to users\u2019 behavior, improve their site, and address pain points that customers might be experiencing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commits\">Commits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Commits in the context of web development refer to the act of saving permanent changes to a set of codes. Just in case, it\u2019s in your best interest to maintain clear version control and backups for your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-context-of-use-analysis\">Context of Use Analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Context of use analysis is the practice of observing users\u2019 behavior on a website. This data can then be used to improve the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conversion-rate\">Conversion Rate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversion rate is the percentage of users that perform a specific action or transaction on a website. A number of factors can affect conversion, including the design of the website itself or an additional marketing campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-relationship-management-crm-software\">Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CRM software is an important tool in managing the various business processes of a company\u2019s online presence, such as sales or customer interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-data-science\">Data Science<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data science is the practice of interpreting numbers and data into meaningful statistics that helps developers make more informed decisions. It ultimately serves as another important tool that helps determine users\u2019 behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-diary-study\">Diary Study<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Approaching data collection from a qualitative perspective, diary studies request that participant users write about their experiences in relation to the subject at hand over a given period of time. The value of such studies is that they can sometimes paint a more vivid picture for a developer\u2019s research, at least compared to dry empirical data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-end-users\">End Users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The end-user is who the developer is making the product for. In one way or another, the entire development of a project comes back to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-eye-tracking\">Eye Tracking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized tools exist that can measure eye activity when using certain devices. The data generated by these tools let developers know where their designs are most strongly leading the eyes\u2014and thus, the user\u2019s attention. Heat maps are typically used to display specific areas that are looked at more than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-group\">Focus Group<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A focus group might be hosted to test a subject or an aspect of a product. Questions guide the discussion toward how users might feel toward a product or how they\u2019d interact with it. Regardless of the exact questions or setting, the main goal is to gain information to further iterate upon the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538-768x404.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/15-heatmap-example-min-1024x538-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-heat-maps\">Heat Maps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A visual representation that shows points of interest on a webpage and usually color-coded to represent magnitude. One popular use of heat maps happens in conjunction with eye-tracking software; spots that cause the eyes to linger on a webpage appear more intense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-key-performance-indicators-kpi\">Key Performance Indicators (KPI)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Key performance indicators are measurements that reveal how well a product is doing. Certain data points on how users are interacting with your site can provide valuable information on what your team is doing well and what they can improve upon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-minimum-viable-product-mvp\">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The MVP is a product with all its important features implemented and typically signifies that the project is ready to launch. Of course, just because it can launch doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t or won\u2019t be improved upon\u2014hence the \u201cminimum\u201d in the name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pain-points\">Pain Points<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pain points refer to the issues that users have when interacting with a website. There are numerous ways to track and look out for pain points in your design, and they are something that a developer always needs to be aware of. Pain points that aren\u2019t resolved will make it more difficult for users to interact with your website and will eventually stop people from coming back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-search-engine-optimization-seo\">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is the practice of making a website more visible on the web through organic search results. Relevant and useful content with frequently searched phrases helps the website place higher in those search results. If done effectively, traffic to the website will increase as its SEO improves because more people will be able to find the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-usability-testing\">Usability Testing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One method of gauging how easy a product is to use is to conduct usability testing. Gathering a group of users to test this can prove how hard or easy it is and whether the product needs further iteration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-engagement\">User Engagement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User engagement is a representation of how they interact with a website. The site needs to provide suitable value for the user in order to maintain or increase engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unit-testing\">Unit Testing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unit testing is the process of testing separate small sections of an app to make sure it\u2019s functioning properly. This testing is especially important because if you forego testing and later get an error, it\u2019s going to be much more difficult to find the true source of the mistake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-web-analytics\">Web Analytics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web analytics is the practice of measuring and analyzing internet activity to optimize its usage.
