It ensures that patient information is protected and secure. With the increasing prevalence of data breaches, it&#8217;s essential for healthcare websites to adhere to HIPAA regulations to maintain patient confidentiality and trust.<\/p>\n<p>This includes implementing strong security measures, encrypting sensitive data, conducting regular risk assessments, and providing proper training on privacy practices.
