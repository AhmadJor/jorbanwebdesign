This lets us figure out what drives customers and use that information to build a strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the issues that our Shopify <strong>development team<\/strong> focuses on before launching a Shopify project:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website performance. What is the loading time of the existing website across its different pages? Can it be improved upon?<\/li>\n<li>Conversions. What is the conversion rate? Is there a clear plan for how the redesign will increase conversions?<\/li>\n<li>Site structure. Did the old website design have a clear site architecture with intuitive navigation?<\/li>\n<li>Color palette. Does the existing color palette serve the brand or does it need to be updated?<\/li>\n<li>Value proposition. Does the existing layout and website copy clearly communicate the brand&#8217;s unique selling proposition or does it need to be refreshed?<\/li>\n<li>Cart abandonment. What is the cart abandonment rate and can it be improved upon? You want more people completing checkouts on your online store.<\/li>\n<li>Success stories. Does the website feature case studies prominently throughout?<\/li>\n<li>Bounce rates. Study user behavior in Google Analytics. If visitors are bouncing off your site after a few seconds, you&#8217;re probably not articulating your value proposition clearly enough. Or, you&#8217;re attracting the wrong visitors to your site.<\/li>\n<li>Authority and credibility. Does your existing site exude authoritativeness? Would you trust it if you were a stranger to it? You should have a plan for how the new version will improve upon marketing and sales aspects. From landing pages to product pages to your homepage, every part of your site should be aligned to strengthen your branding.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\t<h2>The Shopify Web Design and Development Process<\/h2>\n<p>Our approach starts by understanding your customer, their motivations, their barriers to decision-making, and how they currently interact with your website.
