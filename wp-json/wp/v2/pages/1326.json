Usually, a company has a combination of these driving their decisions.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The current site is not <strong>search engine optimized<\/strong>, and probably suffers from performance issues; management wants a leaner, meaner, better-performing site to capture <strong>organic search<\/strong> traffic.<\/li>\n<li>The current site does not articulate the brand value proposition well, and management wants a messaging makeover as part of a larger <strong>content marketing<\/strong> initiative, possibly spanning company <strong>social media<\/strong> channels and other outlets.<\/li>\n<li>The current site looks dated, and management wants a sleeker, more up-to-date aesthetic that puts a brand in the best light.<\/li>\n<li>Conversion rates are abysmal on the current site; management wants the site better optimized for conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Whatever the motive, a <strong>redesigned website<\/strong> can bring massive improvement to a brand&rsquo;s traffic, image, sales, or messaging&mdash;or to all of the above.<\/p>\n\t<h2>Website Redesign vs Refresh<\/h2>\n<p>The terms &ldquo;website redesign&rdquo; and &ldquo;website refresh&rdquo; are often used synonymously, but we think they&rsquo;re not the same at all.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website redesign: an in-depth change to multiple aspects of the site, resulting in substantial differences to the website appearance, user experience, performance, and underlying code.<\/li>\n<li>Website refresh: a refresh is more cosmetic in nature than a redesign and could include updated fonts, updated color scheme, limited user experience updates (for example, a button that gets a new shape), and other minor improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t<h2>Website Redesign Project Plan<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to have a plan when undertaking a <strong>website redesign<\/strong> project. A website redesign project plan makes sure that the goals of the redesign are clear, that tasks are assigned and tracked, and that everyone involved in the project is kept up to date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the issues that our redesign team focuses on before launching a redesign:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website performance. What is the loading time of the <strong>existing website<\/strong> across its different pages? Can it be improved upon?<\/li>\n<li>Conversions. What is the <strong>conversion rate<\/strong>? Is there a clear plan for how the redesign will increase conversions?<\/li>\n<li>Site structure. Did the old website design have a clear site architecture with intuitive navigation?<\/li>\n<li>Color palette. Does the existing <strong>color palette<\/strong> serve the brand or does it need to be updated?<\/li>\n<li>Value proposition. Does the existing layout and website copy clearly communicate the brand&#8217;s unique selling proposition or does it need to be refreshed?<\/li>\n<li>Cart abandonment (for <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/ecommerce-websites\/\"><strong>ecommerce websites<\/strong><\/a>). What is the cart abandonment rate and can it be improved upon? You want more people completing checkouts on your online store.<\/li>\n<li>Success stories. Does the website feature case studies prominently throughout?<\/li>\n<li>Bounce rates. Study user behavior in Google Analytics. If visitors are bouncing off your site after a few seconds, you&#8217;re probably not articulating your value proposition clearly enough. Or, you&#8217;re attracting the wrong visitors to your site.<\/li>\n<li>Authority and credibility. Does your existing site exude authoritativeness? Would you trust it if you were a stranger to it? You should have a plan for how the new version will improve upon <strong>marketing and sales <\/strong>aspects. From landing pages to product pages to your homepage, every part of your site should be aligned to strengthen your branding.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\t<h2>The Website Redesign Process<\/h2>\n<p>We meet with you to understand your <strong>business goals<\/strong> and the performance of your <strong>current website<\/strong>. We&rsquo;ll formulate an action plan together for a custom <strong>website revamp <\/strong>that will <strong>generate leads<\/strong> and sales for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the steps we take with you to <strong>redesign your website<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a benchmark of your <strong>business website&#8217;<\/strong>s performance before the redesign so we can compare how much better our redesign is later on.<\/li>\n<li>Clearly identify the goals that we want to achieve with a <strong>website redesign<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Define what your brand stands for and what your brand message is.<\/li>\n<li>Define your target audience and their pain points so we can create effective <strong>graphic design<\/strong>, <strong>visual elements<\/strong>, and content that will capture their attention and inspire action.<\/li>\n<li>Conduct a competitor analysis to identify opportunities for improvement of the <strong>market strategy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the right <strong>content management <\/strong>system to keep up with the ever-changing digital media landscape and user demands. We build <strong>custom websites<\/strong> on Shopify, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wordpress-agency\/\">WordPress<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/hubspot-agency\/\">Hubspot<\/a>, Drupal, and more! Each site is built with <strong>responsive design<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Want to discuss your <strong>website redesign service options<\/strong>? <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/contact\/\">Contact us today<\/a>&mdash;we&rsquo;re happy to chat!<\/p>\n<h3>Website Redesign Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>A successful <strong>website redesign <\/strong>requires an understanding of<strong> digital marketing<\/strong> more generally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We specialize in ensuring the informational architecture, messaging, SEO, design and development deliver maximum engagement for your <strong>website visitors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>A comprehensive understanding of research metrics and best practices allows us to create engaging user experiences that lead to success with <strong>inbound marketing<\/strong> objectives.<\/p>\n<h3>UX and UI Design<\/h3>\n<p>UX and UI Design is crucial to the success of any website. When creating a unique look and feel for your site, we&#8217;ll refer to your brand guidelines in order to ensure all <strong>visual elements<\/strong>, including colors, logos, graphics, and more are all perfectly cohesive with your company&#8217;s messaging, identity and overall aesthetic. Taking the time to make sure the website is <strong>easy to navigate<\/strong> and all design elements reflect your brand will help craft a seamless <strong>user experience<\/strong> that customers can easily identify and interact with.<\/p>\n<h3>Website Development<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/page-speed-optimization\/\">Site speed<\/a>, security, third-party integrations, SEO, and flexibility are paramount for mature businesses. Our <strong>designers and developers<\/strong> create custom solutions tailored to address these needs and more. We pair <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/web-development\/\"><strong>website development<\/strong><\/a> with a keen eye for branding and design.<\/p>\n\t<h2>What is a Website Redesign Proposal?<\/h2>\n<p>A website redesign proposal is a clear statement of what needs improving about a website&mdash;and what a <strong>custom web<\/strong> redesign would specifically accomplish. For example, a website redesign proposal could cover any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The existing site has an average 93% bounce rate and we propose to reduce that to 84% with better UX.<\/li>\n<li>The existing site does not show up in <strong>search results<\/strong> for any of our target keywords, and we think that site performance is a factor. A faster site will allow us to have a better search presence to capture organic traffic.<\/li>\n<li>Our company is rolling out a comprehensive content strategy and our website is woefully outdated, both in its appearance and also in its messaging. We will more effectively appeal to potential customers by updating the website look and copy to better align with our brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Often, website managers create a website redesign proposal to get buy-in from key executives who make financial decisions for the company.<\/p>\n<p>Other reasons to propose a <strong>site redesign<\/strong> include situations in which an <strong>existing website<\/strong> is not adequately accomplishing the following for a brand.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not engaging their buyer personas<\/li>\n<li>Not attracting top talent<\/li>\n<li>Not fully communicating the value of their products or services<\/li>\n<li>Not serving as a<strong> lead generation<\/strong> driver<\/li>\n<li>Not performing well on <strong>mobile devices<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Not meeting key performance indicators such as conversions<\/li>\n<li>Full of poor<strong> UX design<\/strong> for a suboptimal <strong>customer experience<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Not connecting with their <strong>target audiences<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Not optimized for <strong>search engines<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the sorts of rationales that a website redesign proposal will articulate to get executive approval.<\/p>\n\t<h2>How Often Should You Redesign Your Website?<\/h2>\n<p>Consumer trends, browser technology, and accessibility requirements are always changing; there is no set schedule for redesigning your website. Rather, you should monitor how your current site performs and where it can be improved.<\/p>\n<p>Examining your current website and your company&#8217;s goals on a regular basis can help you find new ways to improve conversion rates (CRO) and user experience (UX) through a website redesign.<\/p>\n\t<h2>Website Redesign Examples<\/h2>\n<p>The following are just a few of our many <strong>award-winning website<\/strong> redesign examples across many industries. <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/case-studies\/\">View our case studies<\/a> for more.<\/p>\n<h3>BetterCloud<\/h3>\n<p>BetterCloud is a SaaS company that helps other companies with their own SaaS management.

A simple custom <strong>site redesign <\/strong>with basic functionality performed by a<strong> digital agency <\/strong>could range between $15,000 to $30,000. This cost may not include additional services such as SEO or <strong>content creation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Bigger and more complex <strong>corporate websites <\/strong>with extra features and functionality will cost significantly more to redesign: $40,000 to $75,000 or higher, depending on the scope of the project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Professional website<\/strong> redesigns are an investment, part of a long-term <strong>marketing plan<\/strong> that helps you reach your target audience and maximize conversions. Your ultimate goal should always be to ensure your website&rsquo;s <strong>responsive design<\/strong> is optimized for performance and usability throughout the entire design journey&mdash;from concept to launch.<\/p>\n<p>Our average <strong>website redesign<\/strong> averages $50,000-$100,000 based on the size and complexity of the site. This is inclusive of a two-day strategy workshop, full UI\/<strong>UX design<\/strong>, custom theme development, content writing, and on-site SEO. For a more accurate estimate of <strong>website cost<\/strong>, be sure to check out our project <strong>cost calculator<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not looking to redesign your entire website and would rather work on your <strong>existing website<\/strong>, we offer our Grow packages starting at $5,000\/month.<\/p>\n<h3>What Determines The Price Of a Website Redesign?<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to getting a<strong> custom quote<\/strong> for <strong>professional website redesign<\/strong> services, there are several factors that play into the price.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of a website redesign is based on the following factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of URLs a site has<\/li>\n<li>The complexity of the site and its features<\/li>\n<li>Whether copywriting and photography is needed<\/li>\n<li>The content management system (CMS)<\/li>\n<li>Whether ongoing site maintenance is needed&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Multiple landing pages with complex navigation may require more design or coding time than creating only a few simple brochure-style pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Additional touches are good to help attract and convert site visitors: good <strong>website copywriting<\/strong>, photography, <strong>app development<\/strong>, and search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<p>When creating <strong>digital experiences<\/strong>, an ultimate goal should be optimizing for both performance and usability. While a CMS can assist in keeping the site organized and easy to maintain, ensuring it is optimized for search engines (national or <strong>local SEO<\/strong>) adds even more time and effort. All of these components come together to form the final cost for your website development project.<\/p>\n<h3>How To Calculate the Cost Of Your Website Redesign Using Our Project Calculator<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering a new website redesign, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much your project will cost.

For any aspects in which the existing design is working well, the new design should leverage those.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, redesigning your website is all about getting more visitors and turning them into customers. To justify the time and expense of a <strong>redesign project<\/strong>, your <strong>website redesign agency partner<\/strong> should have a solid plan in place for how to significantly improve your site over its current baseline.<\/p>\n<h3>What does a web design agency do?<\/h3>\n<p>A good <strong>web design agency<\/strong> can create a professional and modern website for your company. An experienced web design team can build a creative, easy-to-use site that fits the company&#8217;s brand identity and meets customers&#8217; expectations by carefully analyzing their needs and goals. As part of their service, web design agencies often do full planning, which includes working with developers to add things like content management systems, SEO optimization, and technical support. Clients can also use maintenance services after the site goes live to make sure it stays safe and secure. Using the skills and knowledge of a web design agency, businesses can create immersive user experiences that keep customers interested and boost their online presence.<\/p>\n<h3>What are website redesign services?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Website redesign <\/strong>services offer businesses the ability to refresh their <strong>online presence <\/strong>and keep websites looking modern and engaging. Professional <strong>web redesign<\/strong> services provide numerous options for transforming and modernizing a website, from changing color schemes and fonts, to revitalizing old content and adding new features.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Web redesign <\/strong>professionals have extensive knowledge about <strong>user experience <\/strong>design, making sure that customers have an enjoyable experience when accessing your business&#8217;s website and are able to easily navigate between pages. With these services at your disposal, more <strong>potential customers<\/strong> can be reached with an improved website aesthetic and optimized navigational functions.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of any <strong>web redesign<\/strong> service is to give your business a fresh face online while improving digital sales performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Does website redesign affect SEO?<\/h3>\n<p>When redesigning your website, it&#8217;s important to consider how changes might affect your SEO. A good redesign should maintain the URL structures and key pages, as well as ensure that redirects are managed carefully.<\/p>\n<p>For example, 301 redirects can provide a temporary solution, but too many can lead to slow page loads, something that search engine algorithms do not favor.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, removing too many pages from the design could result in the loss of valuable backlinks. Furthermore, if the <strong>redesigned site<\/strong> fails to project a good<strong> user experience<\/strong>, this will inevitably cause a high bounce rate and less overall traffic to your site.<\/p>\n<p>When executed properly, a <strong>website redesign<\/strong> can be beneficial and might even improve your search rankings, so long as no fundamental SEO mistakes have been made.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How do I redesign a website without losing SEO<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It can be hard to redesign a website without losing SEO, but it is doable if you take it step by step.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first priority should be to make a back-up of your website, just in case something unexpected happens.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s important to look at your current SEO standings and what strategies you have been using thus far like utilizing keywords and backlinks effectively.<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining the same content, structure, and URL hierarchy helps keep all links functional when redirecting from old URLs to new ones.<\/li>\n<li>Do on-page optimization of your content by conducting research on relevant keywords or phrases that you can incorporate in the <strong>website design <\/strong>to benefit your SEO ranking.<\/li>\n<li>Test out your new design on a private staging server or another version of the live website to catch possible issues before everything goes public.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Can I redesign an existing website?<\/h3>\n<p>Redesigning an <strong>existing website<\/strong> can be a great way to enhance user engagement and drive conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Before jumping into the redesign, it&#8217;s important to set a goal and assess what in your<strong> current website<\/strong> design is working. It&#8217;s also wise to take a look at how your main competitors design their websites, as it can spark ideas of how you might tweak yours to improve the<strong> user experience<\/strong> of your <strong>website veisitor<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve determined what needs to change, the next step is deciding if you want to do the redesign yourself or outsource it to a <strong>web design <\/strong>professional. Before you launch your new design, make sure to test it with real users and real data. This will help you find any problems with the site that need more work.<\/p>\n<p>After launch, keep an eye out for improvement opportunities, so you&#8217;re constantly striving to make sure your website is providing value for your users.<\/p>\n<h3>How many revisions can I make to the design?<\/h3>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t happy with the design, your designer should give you a set number of changes to make it perfect.
