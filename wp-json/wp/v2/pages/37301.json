Here are some of the top reasons why people choose WordPress over other platforms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free and open source. Anyone can access WordPress, modify it and use it as they wish. There are no upfront fees or restrictions on what you can do with WordPress, making it ideal for\u00a0<strong>website developers<\/strong>\u00a0and companies that value open-ended possibilities.<\/li>\n<li>Extensible.\u00a0<strong>Business owners<\/strong>\u00a0can modify the platform with themes and plugins. It&#8217;s easy to customize your\u00a0<strong>WordPress business<\/strong>\u00a0website. From creating\u00a0<strong>custom plugins<\/strong>\u00a0to building your own theme (as we&#8217;ve done with our custom WordPress theme for our clients), you can extend the functionality of your website endlessly. You can create your own\u00a0<strong>contact forms<\/strong>, set up an ecommerce store with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/woocommerce-agency\/\">WooCommerce<\/a>, and do pretty much whatever you want..<\/li>\n<li>Easy to manage. It doesn&#8217;t take long to get comfortable with how WordPress works. Even beginners can make their way around the back-end dashboard quickly. Plus, there are lots of tutorials and blogs available to help new users get started with their websites.<\/li>\n<li>Flexible. Whether you want a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/b2b-websites\/\">B2B website<\/a>\u00a0or an ecommerce store, WordPress can accommodate all different types of sites. It&#8217;s highly configurable so you have full control over how your site looks and functions.<\/li>\n<li>Mobile responsive. With more people browsing the web on mobile devices these days, having a mobile-friendly website is essential. Fortunately, most WordPress themes come fully responsive so they will look great regardless of what device someone views them on.<\/li>\n<li>Built-in blogging platform. A blog is one of the most important tools for any business or organization. Luckily, WordPress has a built-in blogging platform so you don&#8217;t need any additional software installed on your server for creating posts or managing comments from readers. This makes running a successful blog much easier than ever before!<\/li>\n<li>24\/7 support. WordPress offers\u00a0<strong>live chat\u00a0<\/strong>customer support for their website subscribers with either a Premium or plugin-enabled plan.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whether your website requires sophisticated user authentication procedures, regularly updated content libraries, or large databases that need secure access, WordPress provides the power and flexibility needed to make sure everything runs smoothly.<\/p>\n\t<h2>WordPress Project Plan<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to have a plan when undertaking a WordPress project.

Conversion rates can be optimized by using A\/B tests for different versions of the website and by providing users with an incentive to convert, such as a discount or free shipping.<\/p>\n<p>Our team of experts knows how to make your Wordpress website get more visits and more conversions. We look at your site&#8217;s performance data to make a custom plan to help you get the most out of every site visit.<\/p>\n<p>With our CRO services, you&#8217;ll see measurable improvements in your site&#8217;s performance, such as more conversions, more sales, and happier customers.
