An essential website could cost anywhere from $25,000 to $75,000, while a more complex and feature-rich platform could cost upwards of $200,000 or more.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to work with a reputable and experienced development team that can provide a detailed proposal outlining the project, the scope of work, and associated costs. It is also important to consider ongoing maintenance and support costs, as well as any additional fees for hosting and infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the cost to build a website should be viewed as an investment in the long-term success of the business.<\/p>\n<p>Our average website rebuild averages $75,000-$150,000. This is a one-time, fixed-fee cost that includes the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Strategy<\/li>\n<li>UI\/UX Design<\/li>\n<li>Full-Stack Web Development<\/li>\n<li>Copywriting<\/li>\n<li>Graphic + Asset Creation<\/li>\n<li>Data Entry + Migration<\/li>\n<li>Technical SEO Optimization<\/li>\n<li>Analytics + Goal Setup<\/li>\n<li>UI\/UX Guidelines<\/li>\n<li>Editors Guidelines<\/li>\n<li>Full Ownership of Design + Development<\/li>\n<li>Upon Completion<\/li>\n<li>2 Weeks Post-Launch Support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Determines the Price of a Website Design?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to getting a custom quote for professional website design services, several factors play into the price.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of a website design is based on the following factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The website&#8217;s complexity:<\/strong> A more complex website with custom functionalities and features typically takes more time and effort to design.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The number of pages:<\/strong>&nbsp;The more pages a website has, the more time and effort each page will require to design.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The level of customization:<\/strong>&nbsp;A customized website with unique layouts, graphics, and branding elements will be more expensive than a template-based design.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The timeframe for completion:<\/strong> A shorter deadline for completing the website design can require your designers to work longer hours, increasing the project&#8217;s cost.<\/li>\n<li>Additional services. Services like website hosting,&nbsp;video production, SEO, and ongoing maintenance can add to the overall cost of your website design project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Multiple landing pages with complex navigation may require more design or coding time than creating only a few simple brochure-style pages.<\/p>\n<p>Additional touches are good to help attract and convert site visitors: suitable for website and web design agencies ranked copywriting, photography, app development<strong>,<\/strong>&nbsp;and search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<p>When creating&nbsp;digital experiences, the ultimate goal should be optimized for both performance and usability. While a CMS can assist in keeping the site organized and easy to maintain, ensuring it is optimized for search engines&nbsp;(national or local SEO) adds even more time and effort. All of these components come together to form the final cost for your website development project.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to Calculate the Cost of Your Website Design Using Our Project Calculator<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering a new website design, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much your project will cost.

For example, on an ecommerce site, the design should encourage visitors to check out products.

Website design can be applied to a new site or an existing one. When applied to an existing website, we refer to it as a &#8220;website redesign.&#8221; Website redesign is thus a subset of website design.\n<p>The terms &#8220;website redesign&#8221; and &#8220;website refresh&#8221; are often used synonymously, but we distinguish between the two.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Website redesign:<\/strong> an in-depth change to multiple aspects of the site, resulting in substantial differences in the website&#8217;s appearance, user experience, performance, and underlying code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website refresh:<\/strong> a refresh is more cosmetic in nature than a redesign and could include updated fonts, an updated color scheme, limited user experience updates (for example, a button that gets a new shape), and other minor improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n                            <!--<h3>How do I create a website design project plan?<\/h3>-->\n                            <h3>How do I create a website design project plan?<\/h3>\n                    <p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n                        When we&nbsp;build websites, we always start with a project plan. Your Jorbanproject manager uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-redesign-project-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>the project plan<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;to ensure that goals are clear, tasks are assigned and tracked, and everyone involved in the project is kept up to date.\n<p>Here are some of the many things we focus on when creating a project plan, whether working with a startup, a <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/web-design-agency\/nonprofit\/\">nonprofit<\/a>, or a Fortune 100 company.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The site needs to be optimized for conversions. Doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s an&nbsp;ecommerce store&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/web-design-agency\/b2b\/\">B2B website<\/a>, conversions are the lifeblood of your business.<\/li>\n<li>Site structure is everything. We build the optimal site architecture with intuitive navigation.<\/li>\n<li>Your value proposition must stand out and be communicated. Everything in the design needs to serve this purpose.<\/li>\n<li>The site needs to exude authority and credibility&nbsp;<em>to your target audience<\/em>. What resonates with middle-class teenage girls won&#8217;t exactly speak to business executives, and vice versa.

In our initial meeting, we&#8217;ll discuss your business objectives and website vision. Together, we&#8217;ll develop a tailored, web design and development strategy focused on driving leads and sales for your enterprise.\n<p>Here are the stages of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/website-design-process\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>our website design process<\/u><\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pre-kickoff:<\/strong> We&#8217;ll get to know each other, and begin to understand your target audience and their pain points so we can create effective graphic design<strong>,<\/strong>&nbsp;visual elements, and content that will capture their attention and inspire action. We&#8217;ll also learn more about your brand, business,&nbsp;content management system, and technical requirements.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Kickoff:<\/strong> At the official start of the project; we&#8217;ll define all elements of the project scope and hold a workshop to define success, work on goal identification, and start thinking through structure, design, and development.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Discovery:<\/strong> This is a critical step of web design. We&#8217;re digging deeper, combining notes from the kickoff with our own research and analytics. We build elements like personas, sitemaps, and wireframes, as well as other visual design documents.

In the development phase of the website project, you can expect work on the front-end, back-end, and content management systems. Regular check-ins and early access to a staging server allow us to stay in sync with you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pre-launch:<\/strong> We&#8217;re getting ready for the big day.

By the end of the day, you have a fully functioning, beautiful new website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Post-launch:<\/strong> We&#8217;ll work for at least 10 business days with you to fix any bugs or broken links, and to make routine tweaks.
