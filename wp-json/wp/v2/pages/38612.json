development<\/strong> is the process of us creating your website with the help of computer languages, frameworks, and other tools. It involves making and managing the back-end and front-end parts of a website so it works, is easy to use, and can be reached by anyone. Where website design emphasizes the experience of the user (the person visiting your website), web development focuses on the site\u2019s functionality across every aspect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our team of skilled <strong>website developers<\/strong> excels in the following web development disciplines.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Front-end web<\/strong> development<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Back-end development<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Full-stack development<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\t<h2>Our Website Development Process<\/h2>\n<p>Our web development process helps align development resources, your company goals, and your team members to ensure all aspects of the project are addressed and launched on time.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the steps in our <strong>website design and development<\/strong> process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research<\/li>\n<li>Information architecture<\/li>\n<li>Wireframes<\/li>\n<li>Design<\/li>\n<li>Content<\/li>\n<li>Development<\/li>\n<li>Quality analysis<\/li>\n<li>Launch<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Research<\/h3>\n<p>Research is the first phase of our web development cycle. It includes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initial research<\/li>\n<li>Information gathering<\/li>\n<li>Expectations<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>During our evaluation process, we&#8217;ll figure out what features your site needs to have to maximize revenue and meet your <strong>business requirements<\/strong>. During this phase, we look more closely at each of these features to confirm their scope and find any other needs that weren&#8217;t talked about or listed in the initial proposal.<\/p>\n<h3>Information Architecture<\/h3>\n<p>Information architecture is the structure by which the information on your website will be organized. By mapping everything out, we will help you visualize how and where content and information appear on your website.<\/p>\n<p>We make sure your site is structured for both users and search engines by evaluating and potentially restructuring the information architecture, and we will develop a roadmap for how to build and structure the site moving forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Wireframes<\/h3>\n<p>Once the required page templates have been identified, we proceed to wireframes. Wireframes are &#8220;back of the napkin&#8221; sketches depicting the structure of a page template. It employs black-and-white page elements to provide a sense of where page components will be placed on a page so that users can react and adjust as necessary.<\/p>\n<h4>The Importance of UX and UI Design<\/h4>\n<p>UX and UI design are crucial to the success of any website. When creating a<strong> responsive design <\/strong>with a unique look, our <strong>UX designers<\/strong> refer to your brand guidelines in order to ensure all visual elements, including colors, logos, graphics, and more, are perfectly cohesive with your company&#8217;s messaging, identity, and overall aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Taking the time to make sure the website is easy to navigate and all design elements reflect your brand will help craft a seamless <strong>user experience<\/strong> your customers can easily identify and interact with.<\/p>\n<h3>Web Design<\/h3>\n<p>When approaching website design, we consider your target audience. Through a series of workshops that reveal more about what your customers want and need, we work with you to figure out how to create the best user experience and interface design.<\/p>\n<p>We make sure to fine-tune your site&#8217;s information architecture and write compelling messaging that grabs users&#8217; attention and shows what your brand is all about.<\/p>\n<p>We use best practices for search engine optimization (SEO) to raise the profile and visibility of your company in search results.<\/p>\n<p>Design elements are carefully chosen to give the site a unique look and make it easy to find content and products. Back-end and front-end design work together to make sure the whole site runs smoothly.<\/p>\n<h3>Creating Content<\/h3>\n<p>As our team creates wireframes and designs, it&#8217;s time to get the content ready for injection into your new site design.<\/p>\n<p>Content consists of copy, images, graphics, or other design elements. Our team can handle content creation, or can work with your existing marketing team to ensure that the content they create is aligned with our shared goals.<\/p>\n<p>To better organize your content, we create a content plan that includes each page on the site that needs to be loaded, links to relevant content and creative deliverables, and status columns to monitor <strong>content management<\/strong> and loading.<\/p>\n<h3>Web Development<\/h3>\n<p>Web development includes web design but goes far beyond it. Here are some of the important subdisciplines our <strong>professional web<\/strong> developers work within:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Database architecture involves database management systems like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to design and implement database structures and integrations that power your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Front-end web development<\/strong> is when <strong>HTML and CSS<\/strong> and JavaScript are used to make the parts of your website that your<strong> users interact<\/strong> with.<\/li>\n<li>Back-end development involves a <strong>programming language <\/strong>of choice like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java to build the logic that runs the store on the server side.<\/li>\n<li>Full-stack development means working on both the front-end and back-end parts of the website.<\/li>\n<li>Web security is the process of keeping tech sites safe from attacks, data leaks, and other security risks. Web security must be integrated into the web development process.<\/li>\n<li>Performance optimization is the process of making websites and web apps run faster and work better by optimizing code, shrinking file sizes, using caching, and other methods.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content management systems<\/strong> (CMS) let you control the content and functionality of online stores using platforms like WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Transactional development involves the integration of payment gateways, subscriptions, and other tech features to enable transfer of funds, delivery of services, and other activities necessary to <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/ecommerce-website-agency\/\">ecommerce store<\/a> or other online business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Security, <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/page-speed-optimization\/\">site speed<\/a>, third-party integrations, search engine optimization, and flexibility are paramount for mature businesses. Our designers and developers create custom solutions tailored to address these needs and more. We pair website development with a focus on branding, design, and conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Jorbanis one of the leading web <strong>development companies<\/strong> that specializes in creating custom online stores for businesses of all sizes.

Our team of expert strategists, developers, designers, and project managers work closely with clients to understand their unique needs and create websites tailored to their specific goals and requirements.<\/p>\n<h3>Testing and Quality Assurance<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout our web development process, our team will put a lot of focus on quality assurance (QA). A comprehensive QA audit checklist is completed to ensure your site meets or exceeds the standards of an efficient, fully functioning <strong>modern web.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We care about your website&#8217;s visitors having a positive experience, regardless of the device they&#8217;re using to access it, which is why our checklist includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross device testing<\/li>\n<li><strong>Browser compatibility<\/strong> testing<\/li>\n<li>Bug testing<\/li>\n<li>Process testing<\/li>\n<li>Content formatting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>During our website development process, our team checks the website to ensure it is functioning properly ahead of launch. We ensure that your website works from a technical perspective and from your customers&#8217; side. We verify that the content on your <strong>web pages<\/strong> is accurate, on brand, and grammatically correct.<\/p>\n<h3>Website Launch<\/h3>\n<p>The launch of your new site is an exciting milestone, but our <strong>development job<\/strong> is not done yet. There are still some tasks that we need to complete post-launch to ensure that everything runs smoothly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We go through a technical checklist and make sure the site is running properly.<\/li>\n<li>Our team will make sure the migration strategy is working as it should and your new site is being indexed appropriately.<\/li>\n<li>We check that all of your new site&#8217;s tracking and data are accurate by making sure all of your goals are being triggered and that all of your configurations are correct.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once the site launches, we keep an eye on your website and perform regular website maintenance. It is important to make sure the new site matches the expectations of your users, is easily found on the <strong>world wide web<\/strong>, and is tracked and measured accurately for data-driven decision-making.<\/p>\n\t<h2>Custom WordPress Development<\/h2>\n<p>We build the world\u2019s best WordPress websites for companies large and small across all industries.

Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the <strong>difference between web <\/strong>development and web design:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Web Designers:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our web designers design everything a user encounters when using a website or piece of software. This includes the layout, the colors, the fonts, and the usability.<\/li>\n<li>We participate in either one-on-one client interaction during the design process or team client vision development.<\/li>\n<li>Our web designer team constructs wireframes and prototypes to try out design concepts; provide feedback on visual elements such as logos, brands, and styles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Web Developers<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our web development teams <strong>build websites<\/strong>, creating the code that runs a website, whether it&#8217;s client-side or server-side.<\/li>\n<li>Our web developers bring to life the website design parameters from the design team.<\/li>\n<li>Our<strong> development skills<\/strong> include being the best at a variety of programming languages, including HTML (<strong>HyperText Markup Languages<\/strong>), CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C\/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more on this topic, read <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/web-design-vs-web-development\/\">our article about all the differences between web development and web design<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<h2>Web Development FAQ<\/h2>\n<h3>Which language is best for web development?<\/h3>\n<p>There is no single best language for web development. Our team works closely with you to determine the best languages for your web development based on the requirements and goals of the project we&#8217;re doing for you and the types of <strong>web solutions<\/strong> we&#8217;re implementing.<\/p>\n<p>For example,<strong> HTML, CSS<\/strong>, and JavaScript are essential for front-end development and form the basis of most websites or <strong>web applications<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>On the <strong>back-end web<\/strong> development side, languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, and Node.js each have their strengths. Python is known for its readability and versatility, while PHP is popular for its extensive support and ease of use.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a <strong>web developer&#8217;s job<\/strong>?<\/h3>\n<p>The job of a web developer is to build and <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/website-maintenance-and-support\/\">maintain websites<\/a>.

There are many great web development courses available on such platforms as Udemy and Coursera.<\/p>\n<h3>Which <strong>web development tools <\/strong>does your team use?<\/h3>\n<p>We use a variety of web development tools and technologies to build high-quality websites.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the key tools we use during our process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Vue.js, and Angular for building user interfaces..<\/li>\n<li>Back-end frameworks like Node.js, <strong>Ruby on Rails,<\/strong> and Laravel for building <strong>web APIs<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Content management systems (CMSs) such as WordPress for creating and managing website content.<\/li>\n<li>Development tools such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom for coding, debugging, and testing.<\/li>\n<li>Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure for deploying and scaling web applications.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>What are <strong>HTML tables <\/strong>and forms?<\/h3>\n<p>To fully grasp the fundamentals of HTML coding, you must first understand the three b<strong>uilding block<\/strong>s, which are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tags<\/li>\n<li>Elements<\/li>\n<li>Attributes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>HTML tables are a method of organizing and presenting data on a web page in a structured, grid-like format. Tables are made up of rows and columns, which form cells that can hold data, text, or images.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HTML forms <\/strong>are essential components of all websites, allowing you to input and submit data. Text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and submission buttons are common input elements in forms. They facilitate user interactions by enabling tasks such as account registration, data collection, and search queries, ultimately improving a website&#8217;s user experience and functionality.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you offer <strong>software development<\/strong> services?<\/h3>\n<p>We provide any <strong>software development<\/strong> services that are needed to build your website.
