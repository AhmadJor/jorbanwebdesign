Website design can be applied to a new site or an existing one. When applied to an existing website, we refer to it as a &#8220;website redesign.&#8221; Website redesign is thus a subset of website design.<\/p>\n<p>The terms &#8220;website redesign&#8221; and &#8220;website refresh&#8221; are often used synonymously, but we draw a distinction between the two.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website redesign: an in-depth change to multiple aspects of the site, resulting in substantial differences to the website&#8217;s appearance, user experience, performance, and underlying code.<\/li>\n<li>Website refresh: a refresh is more cosmetic in nature than a redesign and could include updated fonts, an updated color scheme, limited user experience updates (for example, a button that gets a new shape), and other minor improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We are a website design\u00a0<strong>agency based<\/strong>\u00a0in Pittsburgh, PA and serving the entire US and beyond.

A simple custom site design with basic functionality performed by a <strong>digital agency<\/strong>\u00a0could range between $15,000 and $30,000. This cost may not include additional services such as SEO or\u00a0<strong>content creation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bigger and more complex corporate websites done by a professional\u00a0<strong>web agency<\/strong>\u00a0with extra features and functionality will cost significantly more to design: $40,000 to $75,000 or higher, depending on the scope of the project.<\/p>\n<p>Professional web designs are an investment, part of a long-term marketing plan that helps you reach your target audience and maximize conversions. Your ultimate goal should always be to ensure your website&#8217;s responsive design is optimized for performance and usability throughout the entire design journey-from concept to launch.<\/p>\n<p>Our average website design ranges from $50,000 to $150,000 based on the size and complexity of the site. This is inclusive of a two-day strategy workshop, full\u00a0<strong>UI\/UX design<\/strong>s, custom theme development, content writing, and on-site SEO.

A more complex website with custom functionalities and features will typically take more time and effort to design.<\/li>\n<li>The number of pages. The more pages a website has, the more time and effort each page will require to design.<\/li>\n<li>The level of customization. A fully customized website with unique layouts, graphics, and branding elements will be more expensive than a template-based design.<\/li>\n<li>The timeframe for completion. A shorter deadline for completing the website design can require your designers to work longer hours, which can increase the cost of the project.<\/li>\n<li>Additional services. Services like website hosting,\u00a0<strong>video production<\/strong>, SEO, and ongoing maintenance can add to the overall cost of your website design project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Multiple landing pages with complex navigation may require more design or coding time than creating only a few simple brochure-style pages.<\/p>\n<p>Additional touches are good to help attract and convert site visitors: good website copywriting, photography, <strong>app development,<\/strong>\u00a0and search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<p>When creating\u00a0<strong>digital experiences<\/strong>, the ultimate goal should be optimizing for both performance and usability. While a CMS can assist in keeping the site organized and easy to maintain, ensuring it is optimized for\u00a0<strong>search engines<\/strong> (national or local SEO) adds even more time and effort. All of these components come together to form the final cost for your website development project.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n                            <!--\n<h3>What factors and components does our project calculator take into account when determining the cost of your website design?<\/h3>\n\n-->\n                            <h3>\nWhat factors and components does our project calculator take into account when determining the cost of your website design?\n<\/h3>\n                    <p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n                        <p>If you&#8217;re considering a new website design, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much your project will cost.
