					<description><![CDATA[Great post! The difference between web design and web development is often misunderstood. Web design focuses on the visual and aesthetic aspects of a website, creating a user-friendly interface and engaging layouts. On the other hand, web development involves the coding and programming required to bring the design to life, making the website functional and interactive. Both disciplines are essential for a successful website, and understanding their distinctions is crucial for effective collaboration between designers and developers. Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Thanks for sharing your landing pages. At a quick glance, some advice I could offer would be:

1. Add a descriptive heading to the page that explains the value of the service.
2. Add social proof on the page that backs up your offering
3. Focus on the challenges of your customer vs simply stating what you do

Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great content and a lot to unpack.

You mentioned that you would be OK giving some tips about my Services page(s). Here is a link to the start: thecollegefundingspecialists.us/our-services/

I have 2 services that I offer: 


	College Funding - aimed at High School parents to help them minimize the cost of College by maximizing the amount of College Aid/Scholarships that they get


	Student Loan Forgiveness - aimed at physicians, specifically OB/GYN




&quot;aimed at&quot; is something I am planning to do rather than having done it.]]></description>
